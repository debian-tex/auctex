<h1 class="appendix"> A. Changes and New Features </h1>




<a name="SEC93"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> News in 11.83 </h2>

<ul>
<li>
The new function <code>TeX-doc</code> provides easy access to documentation
about commands and packages or information related to TeX and friends
in general.
See section <a href="auctex_8.html#SEC74">Documentation about macros and packages</a>.

</li><li>
You can now get rid of generated intermediate and output files by means
of the new <samp>`Clean'</samp> and <samp>`Clean All'</samp> entries in
<code>TeX-command-list</code> accessible with <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> or the Command
menu.
See section <a href="auctex_8.html#SEC73">Cleaning intermediate and output files</a>.

</li><li>
Support for forward search with PDF files was added.  That means you can
jump to a place in the output file corresponding to the position in the
source file.
See section <a href="auctex_8.html#SEC67">Viewing the formatted output</a>.

<p>Adding support for this feature required the default value of the
variable <code>TeX-output-view-style</code> to be changed.  Please make sure
you either remove any customizations overriding the new default or
incorporate the changes into your customizations if you want to use this
feature.
</p>
</li><li>
TeX error messages of the <code>-file-line-error</code> kind are now
understood in AUCTeX and preview-latex (parsers are still
separate).

</li><li>
Bug fix in XyMTeX support.

</li><li>
The LaTeX tool bar is now enabled by default.
See section <a href="auctex_8.html#SEC65">Starting Processors, Viewers and Other Programs</a>.

</li></ul>

<a name="SEC94"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> News in 11.82 </h2>

<ul>
<li>
Support for the MinionPro LaTeX package was added.

</li><li>
Warnings and underfull/overfull boxes are now being indicated in the
echo area after a LaTeX run, if the respective debugging options are
activated with <code>TeX-toggle-debug-warnings</code> (<kbd>C-c C-t C-w</kbd>) or
<code>TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes</code> (<kbd>C-c C-t C-b</kbd>).  In this case
<code>TeX-next-error</code> will find these warnings in addition to normal
errors.

<p>The key binding <kbd>C-c C-w</kbd> for <code>TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes</code>
(which was renamed from <code>TeX-toggle-debug-boxes</code>) now is
deprecated.
</p>
</li><li>
AUCTeX now can automatically insert a pair of braces after typing
<kbd>_</kbd> or <kbd>^</kbd> in math constructs if the new variable
<code>TeX-electric-sub-and-superscript</code> is set to a non-nil value.

</li><li>
Some language-specific support for French was added.  There now is
completion support for the commands provided by the <samp>`frenchb'</samp> (and
<samp>`francais'</samp>) options of the babel LaTeX package and easier input
of French quotation marks (<code>\\og ...\\fg</code>) which can now be
inserted by typing <kbd>&quot;</kbd>.

</li><li>
Completion support for options of some LaTeX packages was added.

</li><li>
Already in version 11.81 the way to activate AUCTeX changed
substantially.  This should now be done with <code>(load &quot;auctex.el&quot; nil
t t)</code> instead of the former <code>(require 'tex-site)</code>.  Related to this
change <tt>`tex-mik.el'</tt> does not load <tt>`tex-site.el'</tt> anymore.  That
means if you used only <code>(require 'tex-mik)</code> in order to activate
AUCTeX, you have to add <code>(load &quot;auctex.el&quot; nil t t)</code> before the
latter statement.  More detailed information can be found in the
installation instructions.

</li><li>
Handling of verbatim constructs was consolidated across AUCTeX.  This
resulted in the font-latex-specific variables
<code>font-latex-verb-like-commands</code>, <code>font-latex-verbatim-macros</code>,
and <code>font-latex-verbatim-environments</code> being removed and the more
general variables <code>LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-delims</code>,
<code>LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-braces</code>, and
<code>LaTeX-verbatim-environments</code> being added.

</li><li>
The output of a BibTeX run is now checked for warnings and errors,
which are reported in the echo area.

</li><li>
The aliases for <code>font-latex-title-fontify</code> were removed.  Use
<code>font-latex-fontify-sectioning</code> instead.

</li><li>
The problem that Japanese macros where broken across lines was fixed.

</li><li>
Various bug fixes.
</li></ul>

<a name="SEC95"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> News in 11.81 </h2>

<ul>
<li>
<code>LaTeX-mark-section</code> now marks subsections of a given section as
well.  The former behavior is available via the prefix argument.

</li><li>
preview-latex which was previously available separately became a
subsystem of AUCTeX.  There is no documented provision for building
or installing preview-latex separately.  It is still possible to use
and install AUCTeX without preview-latex, however.

</li><li>
The installation procedures have been overhauled and now also install
startup files as part of the process (those had to be copied manually
previously).  You are advised to remove previous installations of
AUCTeX and preview-latex before starting the installation
procedure.  A standard installation from an unmodified tarball no longer
requires Makeinfo or Perl.

<p>Also note that the way AUCTeX is supposed to be activated changed.
Instead of <code>(require 'tex-site)</code> you should now use <code>(load
&quot;auctex.el&quot; nil t t)</code>.  While the former method may still work, the new
method has the advantage that you can deactivate a preactivated
AUCTeX with the statement <code>(unload-feature 'tex-site)</code> before
any of its modes have been used.  This may be important especially for
site-wide installations.
</p>
</li><li>
Support for the babel LaTeX package was added.

</li><li>
Folding a buffer now ensures that the whole buffer is fontified before
the actual folding is carried out.  If this results in unbearably long
execution times, you can fall back to the old behavior of relying on
stealth font locking to do this job in the background by customizing the
variable <code>TeX-fold-force-fontify</code>.

</li><li>
Folded content now reveals part of its original text in a tooltip or the
echo area when hovering with the mouse pointer over it.

</li><li>
The language-specific insertion of quotation marks was generalized.  The
variables <code>LaTeX-german-open-quote</code>,
<code>LaTeX-german-close-quote</code>, <code>LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote</code>,
<code>LaTeX-italian-open-quote</code>, <code>LaTeX-italian-close-quote</code>, and
<code>LaTeX-italian-quote-after-quote</code> are now obsolete.  If you are not
satisfied with the default settings, you should customize
<code>TeX-quote-language-alist</code> instead.

</li><li>
Similar to language-specific quote insertion, AUCTeX now helps you
with hyphens in different languages as well.
See section <a href="auctex_11.html#SEC78">Using AUCTeX with European Languages</a>, for details.

</li><li>
Fill problems in Japanese text introduced in AUCTeX 11.55 were fixed.
AUCTeX tries not to break lines between 1-byte and 2-byte chars.
These features will work in Chinese text, too.

</li><li>
The scaling factor of the fontification of sectioning commands can now
be customized using the variable <code>font-latex-fontify-sectioning</code>.
This variable was previously called <code>font-latex-title-fontify</code>; In
this release we provide an alias but this will disappear in one of the
the next releases.  The faces for the sectioning commands are now called
<code>font-latex-sectioning-<var>N</var>-face</code> (<var>N</var>=0&hellip;5) instead of
<code>font-latex-title-<var>N</var>-face</code> (<var>N</var>=1&hellip;4).  Analogously
the names of the variables holding the related keyword lists were
changed from <code>font-latex-title-<var>N</var>-keywords</code> to
<code>font-latex-sectioning-<var>N</var>-keywords</code>.
See section <a href="auctex_7.html#SEC51">Font Locking</a>, for details.
Make sure to adjust your customizations.

</li><li>
Titles in beamer slides marked by the &quot;\frametitle&quot; command are know
displayed with the new face <code>font-latex-slide-title-face</code>.  You can
add macros to be highlighted with this face to
<code>font-latex-match-slide-title-keywords</code>.

</li><li>
Of course a lot of bugs have been fixed.
</li></ul>

<a name="SEC96"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> News in 11.55 </h2>

<ul>
<li>
A bug was fixed which lead to the insertion of trailing whitespace
during filling.  In particular extra spaces were added to sentence
endings at the end of lines.  You can make this whitespace visible by
setting the variable <code>show-trailing-whitespace</code> to <code>t</code>.  If
you want to delete all trailing whitespace in a buffer, type <kbd>M-x
delete-trailing-whitespace RET</kbd>.

</li><li>
A bug was fixed which lead to a <samp>`*Compile-Log*'</samp> buffer popping up
when the first LaTeX file was loaded in an Emacs session.

</li><li>
On some systems the presence of an outdated Emacspeak package lead to
the error message <samp>`File mode specification error: (error &quot;Variable
binding depth exceeds max-specpdl-size&quot;)'</samp>.  Precautions were added which
prevent this error from happening.  But nevertheless, it is advised to
upgrade or uninstall the outdated Emacspeak package.

</li><li>
The value of <code>TeX-macro-global</code> is not determined during
configuration anymore but at load time of AUCTeX.  Consequently the
associated configuration option <samp>`--with-tex-input-dirs'</samp> was
removed.

</li><li>
Support for the LaTeX Japanese classes <samp>`jsarticle'</samp> and
<samp>`jsbook'</samp> was added.
</li></ul>

<a name="SEC97"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> News in 11.54 </h2>

<ul>
<li>
The parser (used e.g. for <code>TeX-auto-generate-global</code>) was extended
to recognize keywords common in LaTeX packages and classes, like
&quot;\DeclareRobustCommand&quot; or &quot;\RequirePackage&quot;.  Additionally a bug
was fixed which led to duplicate entries in AUCTeX style files.

</li><li>
Folding can now be done for paragraphs and regions besides single
constructs and the whole buffer.  With the new <code>TeX-fold-dwim</code>
command content can both be hidden and shown with a single key binding.
In course of these changes new key bindings for unfolding commands where
introduced.  The old bindings are still present but will be phased out
in future releases.

</li><li>
Info files of the manual now have a .info extension.

</li><li>
There is an experimental tool bar support now.  It is not activated by
default.  If you want to use it, add
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="lisp">(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'LaTeX-install-toolbar)
</pre></td></tr></table><p>to your init file.
</p>
</li><li>
The manual now contains a new chapter &quot;Quick Start&quot;.  It explains the
main features and how to use them, and should be enough for a new user
to start using AUCTeX.

</li><li>
A new section &quot;Font Locking&quot; was added to the manual which explains
syntax highlighting in AUCTeX and its customization.  Together with
the sections related to folding and outlining, the section is part of
the new chapter &quot;Display&quot;.

</li><li>
Keywords for syntax highlighting of LaTeX constructs to be typeset in
bold, italic or typewriter fonts may now be customized.  Besides the
built-in classes, new keyword classes may be added by customizing the
variable <samp>`font-latex-user-keyword-classes'</samp>.  The customization
options can be found in the customization group
<samp>`font-latex-keywords'</samp>.

</li><li>
Verbatim content is now displayed with the <samp>`fixed-pitch'</samp> face. (GNU
Emacs only)

</li><li>
Syntax highlighting should not spill out of verbatim content
anymore. (GNU Emacs only)

</li><li>
Verbatim commands like <samp>`\verb|...|'</samp> will not be broken anymore
during filling.

</li><li>
You can customize the completion for graphic files with 
<code>LaTeX-includegraphics-read-file</code>.

</li><li>
Support for the LaTeX packages <samp>`url'</samp>, <samp>`listings'</samp>,
<samp>`jurabib'</samp> and <samp>`csquotes'</samp> was added with regard to command
completion and syntax highlighting.

</li><li>
Performance of fontification and filling was improved.

</li><li>
Insertion of nodes in Texinfo mode now supports completion of existing
node names.

</li><li>
Setting the variable <code>LaTeX-float</code> to <code>nil</code> now means that you
will not be prompted for the float position of figures and tables.  You
can get the old behaviour of <code>nil</code> by setting the variable to
<code>&quot;&quot;</code>, i.e. an empty string.
See also <a href="auctex_5.html#SEC40">Floats</a>.

</li><li>
The XEmacs-specific bug concerning <code>overlays-at</code> was fixed.

</li><li>
Lots of bug fixes.
</li></ul>

<a name="SEC98"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> News in 11.53 </h2>

<ul>
<li>
The LaTeX math menu can include Unicode characters if your Emacs
built supports it.  See the variable
<code>LaTeX-math-menu-unicode</code>, <a href="auctex_6.html#SEC45">Entering Mathematics</a>.

</li><li>
Bug fixes for XEmacs.

</li><li>
Completion for graphic files in the TeX search path has been added.

</li><li>
<code>start</code> is used for the viewer for MikTeX and fpTeX.

</li><li>
The variable <code>TeX-fold-preserve-comments</code> can now be customized to
deactivate folding in comments.
</li></ul>

<a name="SEC99"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> News in 11.52 </h2>

<ul>
<li>
Installation and menus under XEmacs work again (maybe for the first
time).

</li><li>
Fontification of subscripts and superscripts is now disabled when the
fontification engine is not able to support it properly.

</li><li>
Bug fixes in the build process.
</li></ul>

<a name="SEC100"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> News in 11.51 </h2>

<ul>
<li>
PDFTeX and Source Special support did not work with ConTeXt,
this has been fixed.  Similar for Source Special support under Windows.

</li><li>
Omega support has been added.

</li><li>
Bug fixes in the build process.

</li><li>
<code>TeX-fold</code> now supports folding of environments in Texinfo mode.
</li></ul>

<a name="SEC101"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> News in 11.50 </h2>

<ul>
<li>
The use of source specials when processing or viewing the document can
now be controlled with the new <code>TeX-source-specials</code> minor mode
which can be toggled via an entry in the Command menu or the key binding
<kbd>C-c C-t C-s</kbd>.  If you have customized the variable
<code>TeX-command-list</code>, you have to re-initialize it for this to work.
This means to open a customization buffer for the variable by typing
<code>M-x customize-variable RET TeX-command-list RET</code>, selecting
&quot;Erase Customization&quot; and do your customization again with the new
default.

</li><li>
The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain TeX,
LaTeX, ConTeXt etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
<code>TeX-command-list</code> has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
and the customization will not work correctly.

</li><li>
Support for hiding and auto-revealing macros, e.g. footnotes or
citations, and environments in a buffer was
added, <a href="auctex_7.html#SEC63">Folding Macros and Environments</a>.

</li><li>
You can now control if indentation is done upon typing <kbd>RET</kbd> by
customizing the variable
<code>TeX-newline-function</code>, <a href="auctex_6.html#SEC48">Indenting</a>.

</li><li>
Limited support for <code>doc.sty</code> and <code>ltxdoc.cls</code> (<samp>`dtx'</samp>
files) was added.  The new docTeX mode provides functionality for
editing documentation parts.  This includes formatting (indenting and
filling), adding and completion of macros and environments while staying
in comments as well as syntax highlighting.  (Please note that the mode
is not finished yet.  For example syntax highlighting does not work yet
in XEmacs.)

</li><li>
For macro completion in docTeX mode the AUCTeX style files
<tt>`doc.el'</tt>, <tt>`ltxdoc.el'</tt> and <tt>`ltx-base.el'</tt> were included.
The latter provides general support for low-level LaTeX macros and
may be used with LaTeX class and style files as well.  It is
currently not loaded automatically for those files.

</li><li>
Support for ConTeXt with a separate ConTeXt mode is now included.
Macro definitions for completion are available in Dutch and English.

</li><li>
The filling and indentation code was overhauled and is now able to
format commented parts of the source syntactically correct.  Newly
available functionality and customization options are explained in the
manual.

</li><li>
Filling and indentation in XEmacs with preview-latex and activated
previews lead to the insertion of whitespace before multi-line previews.
AUCTeX now contains facilities to prevent this problem.

</li><li>
If <code>TeX-master</code> is set to <code>t</code>, AUCTeX will now query for a
master file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
alone.  The new function <code>TeX-master-file-ask</code> (bound to <kbd>C-c
_</kbd> is provided for adding the variable manually.

</li><li>
Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font on display devices
which support such fontification.  The variable
<code>font-latex-title-fontify</code> can be customized to restore the old
appearance, i.e. the usage of a different color instead of a change in
size.

</li><li>
Support for <code>alphanum.sty</code>, <code>beamer.cls</code>, <code>booktabs.sty</code>,
<code>captcont.sty</code>, <code>emp.sty</code>, <code>paralist.sty</code>,
<code>subfigure.sty</code> and <code>units.sty</code>/<code>nicefrac.sty</code> was added.
Credits go to the authors mentioned in the respective AUCTeX style
files.

</li><li>
Inserting graphics with <kbd>C-c RET \includegraphics RET</kbd> was improved.
See the variable <code>LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist</code>.

</li><li>
If <code>LaTeX-default-position</code> is <code>nil</code>, don't prompt for
position arguments in Tabular-like
environments, see <a href="auctex_5.html#SEC42">Tabular-like</a>.

</li><li>
Completion for available packages when using <kbd>C-c RET \usepackage
RET</kbd> was improved on systems using the kpathsea library.

</li><li>
The commenting functionality was fixed.  The separate functions for
commenting and uncommenting were unified in one function for paragraphs
and regions respectively which do both.

</li><li>
Syntax highlighting can be customized to fontify quotes delimited by
either &gt;&gt;German&lt;&lt; or &lt;&lt;French&gt;&gt; quotation marks by changing the variable
<code>font-latex-quotes</code>.

</li><li>
Certain TeX/LaTeX keywords for functions, references, variables
and warnings will now be fontified specially.  You may add your own
keywords by customizing the variables
<code>font-latex-match-function-keywords</code>,
<code>font-latex-match-reference-keywords</code>,
<code>font-latex-match-variable-keywords</code> and
<code>font-latex-match-warning-keywords</code>.

</li><li>
If you include the style files <tt>`german'</tt> or <tt>`ngerman'</tt> in a
document (directly or via the <samp>`babel'</samp> package), you should now
customize <code>LaTeX-german-open-quote</code>,
<code>LaTeX-german-close-quote</code> and
<code>LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote</code> instead of <code>TeX-open-quote</code>,
<code>TeX-close-quote</code> and <code>TeX-quote-after-quote</code> if you want to
influence the type of quote insertion.

</li><li>
Upon viewing an output file, the right viewer and command line options
for it are now determined automatically by looking at the extension of
the output file and certain options used in the source file.  The
behavior can be adapted or extended respectively by customizing the
variable <code>TeX-output-view-style</code>.

</li><li>
You can control whether <code>TeX-insert-macro</code> (<kbd>C-c RET</kbd>) ask for
all optional arguments by customizing the variable
<code>TeX-insert-macro-default-style</code>, <a href="auctex_6.html#SEC46">Completion</a>.

</li><li>
<code>TeX-run-discard</code> is now able to completely detach a process that
it started.

</li><li>
The build process was enhanced and is now based on <code>autoconf</code>
making installing AUCTeX a mostly automatic process.  See
<a href="auctex_3.html#SEC7">Installing AUCTeX</a> and <a href="auctex_3.html#SEC17">Installation under MS Windows</a>
for details.
