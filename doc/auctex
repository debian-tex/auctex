AUCTeX
******

AUCTeX is an integrated environment for editing LaTeX and TeX files.

   This file almost documents AUCTeX version 12.

   Although AUCTeX contains a large number of features, there are no
reasons to despair.  You can continue to write TeX and LaTeX documents
the way you are used to, and only start using the multiple features in
small steps.  AUCTeX is not monolithic, each feature described in this
manual is useful by itself, but together they provide an environment
where you will make very few LaTeX errors, and makes it easy to find
the errors that may slip through anyway.

   If you want to make AUCTeX aware of style files and multi-file
documents right away, insert the following in your `.emacs' file.
     (setq TeX-auto-save t)
     (setq TeX-parse-self t)
     (setq-default TeX-master nil)

   NOTE: This documentation is preliminary.  It should however cover
most important points.  Corrections or perhaps rewrites of sections are
VERY WELCOME.

Introduction to AUCTeX
**********************

This section of the AUCTeX manual gives a brief overview of what AUCTeX
is, and the section is also available as a `README' file.  It is *not*
an attempt to document AUCTeX.  Real documentation for AUCTeX is
available in the rest of the manual, which you can find in the `doc'
directory.

   Read the `INSTALL' or `INSTALL.windows' file respectively for
information about how to install AUCTeX.  The files comprise the same
information as the Installation chapter in the AUCTeX manual.

   If you are upgrading from the previous version of AUCTeX, the latest
changes can be found in the `CHANGES' file.  If you are upgrading from
an older version, read the History chapter in the AUCTeX manual.

   AUCTeX is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for
writing input files for TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt using GNU Emacs.

   AUCTeX lets you run TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt and LaTeX/ConTeXt-related
tools, such as a output filters or post processor from inside Emacs.
Especially `running LaTeX' is interesting, as AUCTeX lets you browse
through the errors TeX reported, while it moves the cursor directly to
the reported error, and displays some documentation for that particular
error.  This will even work when the document is spread over several
files.

   AUCTeX automatically indents your `LaTeX-source', not only as you
write it -- you can also let it indent and format an entire document.
It has a special outline feature, which can greatly help you `getting an
overview' of a document.

   Apart from these special features, AUCTeX provides a large range of
handy Emacs macros, which in several different ways can help you write
your LaTeX/ConTeXt documents fast and painlessly.

   All features of AUCTeX are documented using the GNU Emacs online
documentation system.  That is, documentation for any command is just a
key click away!

   AUCTeX is written entirely in Emacs-Lisp, and hence you can easily
add new features for your own needs.  It was not made as part of any
particular employment or project (apart from the AUCTeX project
itself).  AUCTeX is distributed under the `GNU Emacs General Public
License' and may therefore almost freely be copied and redistributed.

   The next sections are a short introduction to some `actual' features.
For further information, refer to the built-in online documentation of
AUCTeX.

Indentation and formatting
==========================

AUCTeX may automatically indent your document as you write it. By
pressing <lfd> instead of <ret> at the end of a line, the current line
is indented by two spaces according to the current environment level,
and the cursor is moved down one line.  By pressing <tab>, the current
line is indented, and the cursor stays where it is.  The well-known
Emacs feature `format-paragraph' (`M-q') is reimplemented especially
for AUCTeX to follow the indentation.  A special command
`LaTeX-fill-buffer' lets you indent an entire document like the
well-known C utility indent (this time, only according to the LaTeX
structure :-).

Completion
==========

By studying your `\documentclass' command (in the top of your
document), and consulting a precompiled list of (La)TeX symbols from a
large number of TeX and LaTeX files, AUCTeX is aware of the LaTeX
commands you should be able to use in this particular document.  This
`knowledge' of AUCTeX is used for two purposes.

  1. To make you able to `complete' partly written LaTeX commands. You
     may e.g. write `\renew' and press `M-<tab>'
     (`TeX-complete-symbol'), and then AUCTeX will complete the word
     `\renewcommand' for you. In case of ambiguity it will display a
     list of possible completions.

  2. To aid you inserting environments, that is \begin - \end pairs.
     This is done by pressing C-c C-e (LaTeX-environment), and you will
     be prompted for which `environment' to insert.

Editing your document
=====================

A number of more or less intelligent keyboard macros have been defined
to aid you editing your document.  The most important are listed below.

`LaTeX-environment'
     (`C-c C-e') Insert a `\begin{}' -- `\end{}' pair as described
     above.

`LaTeX-section'
     (`C-c C-s') Insert one of `\chapter', `\section', etc.

`TeX-font'
     (`C-c C-f C-r', `C-c C-f C-i', `C-c C-f C-b') Insert one of
     `\textrm{ }'), `\textit{ \/}' `\textbf{ }' etc.

   A number of additional functions are available.  But it would be far
too much to write about here.  Refer to the rest of the AUCTeX
documentation for further information.

Running LaTeX
=============

When invoking one of the commands `TeX-command-master' (`C-c C-c') or
`TeX-command-region' (`C-c C-r') LaTeX is run on either the entire
current document or a given region of it.  The Emacs view is split in
two, and the output of TeX is printed in the second half of the screen,
as you may simultaneously continue editing your document.  In case TeX
finds any errors when processing your input you can call the function
`TeX-next-error' (`C-c `') which will move the cursor to the first
given error, and display a short explanatory text along with the
message TeX gave.  This procedure may be repeated until all errors have
been displayed.  By pressing `C-c C-w' (`TeX-toggle-debug-boxes') you
can toggle whether the browser also should notify over-full/under-full
boxes or not.

   Once you've successfully formatted your document, you may preview or
print it by invoking `TeX-command-master' again.

Outlines
========

Along with AUCTeX comes support for outline mode for Emacs, which lets
you browse the sectioning structure of your document, while you will
still be able to use the full power of the rest of the AUCTeX
functionality.

Inserting Frequently Used Commands
**********************************

The most commonly used commands/macros of AUCTeX are those which simply
insert templates for often used TeX and/or LaTeX/ConTeXt constructs,
like font changes, handling of environments, etc.  These features are
very simple, and easy to learn, and help you avoid stupid mistakes like
mismatched braces, or `\begin{}'-`\end{}' pairs.

* Menu:

* Quotes::                      Inserting double quotes
* Font Specifiers::             Inserting Font Specifiers
* Sectioning::                  Inserting chapters, sections, etc.
* Environments::                Inserting Environment Templates


File: auctex,  Node: Quotes,  Next: Font Specifiers,  Prev: Frequently Used Commands,  Up: Frequently Used Commands

Insertion of Quotes, Dollars, and Braces
========================================

In TeX, literal double quotes `"like this"' are seldom used, instead
two single quotes are used ```like this'''.  To help you insert these
efficiently, AUCTeX allows you to continue to press `"' to insert two
single quotes.  To get a literal double quote, press `"' twice.

 - Command: TeX-insert-quote COUNT
     (`"') Insert the appropriate quote marks for TeX.

     Inserts the value of `TeX-open-quote' (normally ```') or
     `TeX-close-quote' (normally `''') depending on the context.  With
     prefix argument, always inserts `"' characters.

 - User Option: TeX-open-quote
     String inserted by typing `"' to open a quotation.

 - User Option: TeX-close-quote
     String inserted by typing `"' to close a quotation.

 - User Option: TeX-quote-after-quote
     Determines the behavior of `"'.  If it is non-nil, typing `"' will
     insert a literal double quote.  The respective values of
     `TeX-open-quote' and `TeX-close-quote' will be inserted after
     typing `"' once again.

   If you include the style files `german' or `ngerman'
`TeX-open-quote' and `TeX-close-quote' will be set to the values of
`LaTeX-german-open-quote' and `LaTeX-german-close-quote' respectively.
`TeX-quote-after-quote' will be set to the value of
`LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote'.  If you write texts which facilitate
the style files mentioned before, you should customize those special
variables instead of the standard variables.

   In AUCTeX, dollar signs should match like they do in TeX.  This has
been partially implemented, we assume dollar signs always match within
a paragraph.  The first `$' you insert in a paragraph will do nothing
special.  The second `$' will match the first.  This will be indicated
by moving the cursor temporarily over the first dollar sign.  If you
enter a dollar sign that matches a double dollar sign `$$' AUCTeX will
automatically insert two dollar signs.  If you enter a second dollar
sign that matches a single dollar sign, the single dollar sign will
automatically be converted to a double dollar sign.

 - Command: TeX-insert-dollar ARG
     (`$') Insert dollar sign.

     Show matching dollar sign if this dollar sign end the TeX math
     mode.  Ensure double dollar signs match up correctly by inserting
     extra dollar signs when needed.

     With optional ARG, insert that many dollar signs.

   To avoid unbalanced braces, it is useful to insert them pairwise.
You can do this by typing `C-c {'.

 - Command: TeX-insert-braces
     (`C-c {') Make a pair of braces and position the cursor to type
     inside of them.

Inserting Font Specifiers
=========================

Perhaps the most used keyboard commands of AUCTeX are the short-cuts
available for easy insertion of font changing macros.

   If you give an argument (that is, type `C-u') to the font command,
the innermost font will be replaced, i.e. the font in the TeX group
around point will be changed.  The following table shows the available
commands, with `-!-' indicating the position where the text will be
inserted.

`C-c C-f C-r'
     Insert roman \textrm{-!-} text.

`C-c C-f C-b'
     Insert bold face `\textbf{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-i'
     Insert italics `\textit{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-e'
     Insert emphasized `\emph{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-s'
     Insert slanted `\textsl{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-t'
     Insert typewriter `\texttt{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-c'
     Insert SMALL CAPS `\textsc{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-d'
     Delete the innermost font specification containing point.


 - Command: TeX-font ARG
     (`C-c C-f') Insert template for font change command.

     If REPLACE is not nil, replace current font.  WHAT determines the
     font to use, as specified by `TeX-font-list'.

 - User Option: TeX-font-list
     List of fonts used by TeX-font.

     Each entry is a list with three elements.  The first element is the
     key to activate the font.  The second element is the string to
     insert before point, and the third element is the string to insert
     after point.  An optional fourth element means always replace if
     not nil.

Inserting chapters, sections, etc.
==================================

Insertion of sectioning macros, that is `\chapter', `\section',
`\subsection', etc. and accompanying `\label''s may be eased by using
`C-c C-s'.  This command is highly customizable, the following
describes the default behavior.

   When invoking you will be asked for a section macro to insert.  An
appropriate default is automatically selected by AUCTeX, that is
either: at the top of the document; the top level sectioning for that
document style, and any other place: The same as the last occurring
sectioning command.

   Next, you will be asked for the actual name of that section, and
last you will be asked for a label to be associated with that section.
The label will be prefixed by the value specified in
`LaTeX-section-hook'.

 - Command: LaTeX-section ARG
     (`C-c C-s') Insert a sectioning command.

     Determine the type of section to be inserted, by the argument ARG.

        * If ARG is nil or missing, use the current level.

        * If ARG is a list (selected by C-u), go downward one level.

        * If ARG is negative, go up that many levels.

        * If ARG is positive or zero, use absolute level:
             + 0 : part

             + 1 : chapter

             + 2 : section

             + 3 : subsection

             + 4 : subsubsection

             + 5 : paragraph

             + 6 : subparagraph

     The following variables can be set to customize the function.

    `LaTeX-section-hook'
          Hooks to be run when inserting a section.

    `LaTeX-section-label'
          Prefix to all section references.


   The precise behavior of `LaTeX-section' is defined by the contents
of `LaTeX-section-hook'.

 - User Option: LaTeX-section-hook
     List of hooks to run when a new section is inserted.

     The following variables are set before the hooks are run

    LEVEL
          Numeric section level, default set by prefix arg to
          `LaTeX-section'.

    NAME
          Name of the sectioning command, derived from LEVEL.

    TITLE
          The title of the section, default to an empty string.

    TOC
          Entry for the table of contents list, default nil.

    DONE-MARK
          Position of point afterwards, default nil meaning after the
          inserted text.

     A number of hooks are already defined.  Most likely, you will be
     able to get the desired functionality by choosing from these hooks.

    `LaTeX-section-heading'
          Query the user about the name of the sectioning command.
          Modifies LEVEL and NAME.

    `LaTeX-section-title'
          Query the user about the title of the section. Modifies TITLE.

    `LaTeX-section-toc'
          Query the user for the toc entry.  Modifies TOC.

    `LaTeX-section-section'
          Insert LaTeX section command according to NAME, TITLE, and
          TOC.  If TOC is nil, no toc entry is inserted.  If TOC or
          TITLE are empty strings, DONE-MARK will be placed at the
          point they should be inserted.

    `LaTeX-section-label'
          Insert a label after the section command.  Controlled by the
          variable `LaTeX-section-label'.

     To get a full featured `LaTeX-section' command, insert

          (setq LaTeX-section-hook
                '(LaTeX-section-heading
          	LaTeX-section-title
          	LaTeX-section-toc
          	LaTeX-section-section
          	LaTeX-section-label))

     in your `.emacs' file.

   The behavior of `LaTeX-section-label' is determined by the variable
`LaTeX-section-label'.

 - User Option: LaTeX-section-label
     Default prefix when asking for a label.

     If it is a string, it is used unchanged for all kinds of sections.
     If it is nil, no label is inserted.  If it is a list, the list is
     searched for a member whose car is equal to the name of the
     sectioning command being inserted.  The cdr is then used as the
     prefix.  If the name is not found, or if the cdr is nil, no label
     is inserted.

     By default, chapters have a prefix of `cha:' while sections and
     subsections have a prefix of `sec:'.  Labels are not automatically
     inserted for other types of sections.

Inserting Environment Templates
===============================

A large apparatus is available that supports insertions of environments,
that is `\begin{}' -- `\end{}' pairs.

   AUCTeX is aware of most of the actual environments available in a
specific document.  This is achieved by examining your `\documentclass'
command, and consulting a precompiled list of environments available in
a large number of styles.

   You insert an environment with `C-c C-e', and select an environment
type.  Depending on the environment, AUCTeX may ask more questions
about the optional parts of the selected environment type.  With `C-u
C-c C-e' you will change the current environment.

 - Command: LaTeX-environment ARG
     (`C-c C-e')  AUCTeX will prompt you for an environment to insert.
     At this prompt, you may press <TAB> or <SPC> to complete a
     partially written name, and/or to get a list of available
     environments.  After selection of a specific environment AUCTeX may
     prompt you for further specifications.

     If the optional argument ARG is not-nil (i.e. you have given a
     prefix argument), the current environment is modified and no new
     environment is inserted.

   As a default selection, AUCTeX will suggest the environment last
inserted or, as the first choice the value of the variable
`LaTeX-default-environment'.

 - User Option: LaTeX-default-environment
     Default environment to insert when invoking `LaTeX-environment'
     first time.

   If the document is empty, or the cursor is placed at the top of the
document, AUCTeX will default to insert a `document' environment.

   Most of these are described further in the following sections, and
you may easily specify more, as described in `Customizing environments'.

* Menu:

* Equations::                   Equations
* Floats::                      Floats
* Itemize-like::                Itemize-like
* Tabular-like::                Tabular-like
* Customizing environments::    Customizing environments

   You can close the current environment with `C-c ]', but we suggest
that you use `C-c C-e' to insert complete environments instead.

 - Command: LaTeX-close-environment
     (`C-c ]') Insert an `\end' that matches the current environment.


File: auctex,  Node: Equations,  Next: Floats,  Prev: Environments,  Up: Environments

Equations
---------

When inserting equation-like environments, the `\label' will have a
default prefix, which is controlled by the following variables:

 - User Option: LaTeX-equation-label
     Prefix to use for `equation' labels.

 - User Option: LaTeX-eqnarray-label
     Prefix to use for `eqnarray' labels.

 - User Option: LaTeX-amsmath-label
     Prefix to use for amsmath equation labels.  Amsmath equations
     include `align', `alignat', `xalignat', `aligned', `flalign' and
     `gather'.


File: auctex,  Node: Floats,  Next: Itemize-like,  Prev: Equations,  Up: Environments

Floats
------

Figures and tables (i.e., floats) may also be inserted using AUCTeX.
After choosing either `figure' or `table' in the environment list
described above, you will be prompted for a number of additional things.

FLOAT-TO
     This field is the option of float environments that controls how
     they are placed in the final document.  In LaTeX this is a
     sequence of the letters `htbp' as described in the LaTeX manual.
     The value will default to the value of `LaTeX-float'.

CAPTION
     This is the caption of the float.

LABEL
     The label of this float.  The label will have a default prefix,
     which is controlled by the variables `LaTeX-figure-label' and
     `LaTeX-table-label'.

   Moreover, in the case of a `figure' environment, you will be asked if
you want to insert a `center' environment inside the figure.

 - User Option: LaTeX-float
     Default placement for floats.

 - User Option: LaTeX-figure-label
     Prefix to use for figure labels.

 - User Option: LaTeX-table-label
     Prefix to use for table labels.


File: auctex,  Node: Itemize-like,  Next: Tabular-like,  Prev: Floats,  Up: Environments

Itemize-like
------------

In an itemize-like environment, nodes (i.e., `\item's) may be inserted
using `C-c <LFD>'.

 - Command: LaTeX-insert-item
     (`C-c <LFD>') Close the current item, move to the next line and
     insert an appropriate `\item' for the current environment. That is,
     `itemize' and `enumerate' will have `\item ' inserted, while
     `description' will have `\item[]' inserted.

When inserting Tabular-like environments, that is, `tabular' `array'
etc., you will be prompted for a template for that environment.
Related variables:

 - User Option: LaTeX-default-format
     Default format string for array and tabular environments.

 - User Option: LaTeX-default-position
     Default position string for array and tabular environments.  If
     nil, act like the empty string is given, but don't prompt for a
     position.

Entering Mathematics
====================

TeX is written by a mathematician, and has always contained good
support for formatting mathematical text.  AUCTeX supports this
tradition, by offering a special minor mode for entering text with many
mathematical symbols.  You can enter this mode by typing `C-c ~'.

 - Command: LaTeX-math-mode
     (`C-c ~') Toggle LaTeX-math-mode.  This is a minor mode rebinding
     the key `LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix' to allow easy typing of
     mathematical symbols.  ``' will read a character from the keyboard,
     and insert the symbol as specified in `LaTeX-math-list'.  If given
     a prefix argument, the symbol will be surrounded by dollar signs.

   You can use another prefix key (instead of ``') by  setting the
variable LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix.

 - User Option: LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix
     A string containing the prefix of `LaTeX-math-mode' commands; This
     value defaults to ``'.

   The variable `LaTeX-math-list' holds the actual mapping.

 - User Option: LaTeX-math-list
     A list containing key command mappings to use in `LaTeX-math-mode'.
     The car of each element is the key and the cdr is the macro name.

   The AUCTeX distributions includes a reference card for
`LaTeX-math-mode' with a list of all math mode commands.

Completion
==========

Emacs lisp programmers probably know the `lisp-complete-symbol'
command, usually bound to `M-<TAB>'.  Users of the wonderful ispell
mode know and love the `ispell-complete-word' command from that
package.  Similarly, AUCTeX has a `TeX-complete-symbol' command,
usually bound to `M-<TAB>'.  Using `LaTeX-complete-symbol' makes it
easier to type and remember the names of long LaTeX macros.

   In order to use `TeX-complete-symbol', you should write a backslash
and the start of the macro.  Typing `M-<TAB>' will now complete as much
of the macro, as it unambiguously can.  For example, if you type
``\renewc'' and then ``M-<TAB>', it will expand to ``\renewcommand''.

 - Command: TeX-complete-symbol
     (`M-<TAB>')  Complete TeX symbol before point.

   A more direct way to insert a macro is with `TeX-insert-macro',
bound to `C-c C-m'.  It has the advantage over completion that it knows
about the argument of most standard LaTeX macros, and will prompt for
them.  It also knows about the type of the arguments, so it will for
example give completion for the argument to `\include'.  Some examples
are listed below.

 - Command: TeX-insert-macro
     (`C-c C-m') Prompt (with completion) for the name of a TeX macro,
     and if AUCTeX knows the macro, prompt for each argument.

   As a default selection, AUCTeX will suggest the macro last inserted
or, as the first choice the value of the variable `TeX-default-macro'.

 - User Option: TeX-default-macro
     Default macro to insert when invoking `TeX-insert-macro' first
     time.

   A faster alternative is to bind the function `TeX-electric-macro' to
`\'.  This can be done by setting the variable `TeX-electric-escape'

 - User Option: TeX-electric-escape
     If this is non-nil when AUCTeX is loaded, the TeX escape character
     `\' will be bound to `TeX-electric-macro'

   The difference between `TeX-insert-macro' and `TeX-electric-macro'
is that space will complete and exit from the minibuffer in
`TeX-electric-macro'.  Use <TAB> if you merely want to complete.

 - Command: TeX-electric-macro
     Prompt (with completion) for the name of a TeX macro, and if
     AUCTeX knows the macro, prompt for each argument.  Space will
     complete and exit.

   By default AUCTeX will put an empty set braces `{}' after a macro
with no arguments to stop it from eating the next whitespace.  This can
be stopped by entering `LaTeX-math-mode', *note Mathematics::, or by
setting `TeX-insert-braces' to nil

 - User Option: TeX-insert-braces
     If non-nil, append a empty pair of braces after inserting a macro.

   Completions work because AUCTeX can analyze TeX files, and store
symbols in emacs lisp files for later retrieval.  *Note Automatic::, for
more information.

   AUCTeX will also make completion for many macro arguments, for
example existing labels when you enter a `\ref' macro with
`TeX-insert-macro' or `TeX-electric-macro', and BibTeX entries when you
enter a `\cite' macro.  For this kind of completion to work, parsing
must be enabled as described in *note Parsing Files::.  For `\cite' you
must also make sure that the BibTeX files have been saved at least once
after you enabled automatic parsing on save, and that the basename of
the BibTeX file does not conflict with the basename of one of TeX files.


File: auctex,  Node: Commenting,  Next: Marking and formatting,  Prev: Completion,  Up: Advanced Features

Commenting
==========

It is often necessary to comment out temporarily a region of TeX or
LaTeX code.  This can be done with the commands `C-c ;' and `C-c %'.
`C-c ;' will comment out all lines in the current region, while `C-c %'
will comment out the current paragraph.  Type `C-c ;' again to
uncomment all lines of a commented region, or `C-c %' again to
uncomment all comment lines around point.  These commands will insert
or remove a single `%' respectively.

 - Command: TeX-comment-or-uncomment-region
     (`C-c ;') Add or remove `%' from the beginning of each line in the
     current region.  Uncommenting works only if the region encloses
     solely commented lines.  If AUCTeX should not try to guess if the
     region should be commented or uncommented the commands
     `TeX-comment-region' and `TeX-uncomment-region' can be used to
     explicitely comment or uncomment the region in concern.

 - Command: TeX-comment-or-uncomment-paragraph
     (`C-c %') Add or remove `%' from the beginning of each line in the
     current paragraph.  When removing `%' characters the paragraph is
     considered to consist of all preceding and succeeding lines
     starting with a `%', until the first non-comment line.

Marking, Formatting and Indenting
=================================

The word `formatting' is used with two meanings in this document.
Either letting TeX format the document, or letting AUCTeX make the
LaTeX source look better.  This section deals with the latter.

   AUCTeX contains very advanced functionality for formatting the LaTeX
source which comprises indentation and filling and can be done
automatically or on demand.

   Filling deals with the insertion of line breaks to prevent lines from
becoming wider than what is specified in `fill-column'.  The linebreaks
will be inserted automatically if `auto-fill-mode' is enabled.  In this
case the source is not only filled but also indented automatically as
you write it.

   Indentation is done by LaTeX environments and by TeX groups, that is
the body of an environment is indented by the value of
`LaTeX-indent-level' (default 2).  Also, items of an `itemize-like'
environment are indented by the value of `LaTeX-item-indent', default
-2.  This indentation makes it easier to see the structure of the
document, and to catch errors such as a missing close brace.  Thus, the
indentation is done for precisely the same reasons that you would
indent ordinary computer programs.

   The following is a short sample of an itemize environment indented by
AUCTeX.  If more environments are nested, they are indented
`accumulated' just like most programming languages usually are seen
indented in nested constructs.

     \begin{itemize}
     \item Insertion of templates for logical-structural compositions such as
       environments and sections.
     \item Hot-keys for easy access to certain often used constructs, e.g.,
       font changes, accented letters, and mathematical symbols.
     \item Running application programs (such as \TeX), and then parsing
       the output so that errors in the document may be located
       easily.
     \item Support for multi-file documents.
     \item Online help for \AllTeX\ error messages.
     \item Outlining\Dash i.e., manipulating the document as a composition
       of nested/sequential logical constructs.
     \item Instant formatting and indentation of the \ascii-document in
       order to make it easier to read.
     \item `Completion' (and thereby spell-checking) of partially written
       control sequences.
     \end{itemize}

   You can format and indent single lines, paragraphs, environments, or
sections.

`<TAB>'
     `LaTeX-indent-line' will indent the current line.

`<LFD>'
     `reindent-then-newline-and-indent' indents the current line, and
     then inserts a new line (much like <RET>) and move the cursor to an
     appropriate position by the left margin.

`M-q'
     Alias for `C-c C-q C-p'

`C-c C-q C-p'
     `LaTeX-fill-paragraph' will reformat or `fill' the current
     paragraph.

`C-c C-q C-e'
     `LaTeX-fill-environment' will reformat or `fill' the current
     environment.  This may e.g. be the `document' environment, in
     which case the entire document will be formatted.

`C-c C-q C-s'
     `LaTeX-fill-section' will reformat or `fill' the current logical
     sectional unit.

`M-g'
     Alias for `C-c C-q C-r'

`C-c C-q C-r'
     `LaTeX-fill-region' will format or `fill' the current region.

 - User Option: LaTeX-indent-environment-list
     List of environments with special indentation.  The second element
     in each entry is the function to calculate the indentation level in
     columns.

     The filling code currently cannot handle tabular-like environments
     which will be completely messed-up if you try to format them.
     This is why most of these environments are included in this
     customization option without a special indentation function.  This
     will prevent that they get filled.

 - User Option: LaTeX-indent-level
     Number of spaces to add to the indentation for each `\begin' not
     matched by a `\end'.

 - User Option: LaTeX-item-indent
     Number of spaces to add to the indentation for `\item''s in list
     environments.

 - User Option: TeX-brace-indent-level
     Number of spaces to add to the indentation for each `{' not
     matched by a `}'.

 - User Option: LaTeX-syntactic-comments
     If non-nil comments will be filled and indented according to LaTeX
     syntax.  Otherwise they will be filled like normal text.

 - User Option: LaTeX-fill-break-at-separators
     List of separators before or after which respectively line breaks
     will be inserted if they do not fit into one line.  The separators
     can be curly braces, brackets, switches for inline math (`$', `\(',
     `\)') and switches for display math (`\[', `\]').  Such formatting
     can be useful to make macros and math more visible or to prevent
     overfull lines in the LaTeX source in case a package for
     displaying formatted TeX output inside the Emacs buffer, like
     preview-latex, is used.

 - User Option: LaTeX-fill-break-before-code-comments
     Code comments are comments preceded by some other text in the same
     line.  When a paragraph containing such a comment is to be filled,
     the comment start will be seen as a border after which no line
     breaks will be inserted in the same line.  If the option
     `LaTeX-fill-break-before-code-comments' is enabled (which is the
     default) and the comment does not fit into the line, a line break
     will be inserted before the last non-comment word to minimize the
     chance that the line becomes overfull.

Outlining the Document
======================

AUCTeX supports the standard outline minor mode using LaTeX/ConTeXt
sectioning commands as header lines.  *Note Outline Mode:
(emacs)Outline Mode.  By default `outline-minor-mode' will use the
prefix key `C-c' which is also used by AUCTeX, so it is suggested that
you choose another prefix key by inserting

       (setq outline-minor-mode-prefix "\C-c\C-o") ; Or whatever...

   in your `.emacs' file.

   You can add your own headings by setting the variable
`TeX-outline-extra'.

 - Variable: TeX-outline-extra
     List of extra TeX outline levels.

     Each element is a list with two entries.  The first entry is the
     regular expression matching a header, and the second is the level
     of the header.  A `^' is automatically prepended to the regular
     expressions in the list, so they must match text at the beginning
     of the line.

     See `LaTeX-section-list' or `ConTeXt-INTERFACE-section-list' for
     existing header levels.

   The following example add `\item' and `\bibliography' headers, with
`\bibliography' at the same outline level as `\section', and `\item'
being below `\subparagraph'.

     (setq TeX-outline-extra
           '(("[ \t]*\\\\\\(bib\\)?item\\b" 7)
     	("\\\\bibliography\\b" 2)))

   You may want to check out the unbundled `out-xtra' package for even
better outline support.  It is available from your favorite emacs lisp
archive.

The most powerful features of AUCTeX may be those allowing you to run
(La)TeX/ConTeXt and other external commands like BibTeX and `makeindex'
from within Emacs, viewing and printing the results, and moreover
allowing you to _debug_ your documents.

Executing Commands
==================

Formatting the document with TeX, LaTeX or ConTeXt, viewing with a
previewer, printing the document, running BibTeX, making an index, or
checking the document with `lacheck' or `chktex' all require running an
external command.

   There are two ways to run an external command, you can either run it
on all of the current documents with `TeX-command-master', or on the
current region with `TeX-command-region'.

 - Command: TeX-command-master
     (`C-c C-c')  Query the user for a command, and run it on the master
     file associated with the current buffer.  The name of the master
     file is controlled by the variable `TeX-master'.  The available
     commands are controlled by the variable `TeX-command-list'.

   *Note Installation::, for a discussion about `TeX-command-list' and
*Note Multifile:: for a discussion about `TeX-master'.

 - Command: TeX-command-region
     (`C-c C-r') Query the user for a command, and run it on the "region
     file".  Some commands (typically those invoking TeX or LaTeX) will
     write the current region into the region file, after extracting the
     header and tailer from the master file.  If mark is not active,
     use the old region.  The name of the region file is controlled by
     the variable `TeX-region'.  The name of the master file is
     controlled by the variable `TeX-master'.  The header is all text
     up to the line matching the regular expression `TeX-header-end'.
     The trailer is all text from the line matching the regular
     expression `TeX-trailer-start'.  The available commands are
     controlled by the variable `TeX-command-list'.

   AUCTeX will allow one process for each document, plus one process
for the region file to be active at the same time.  Thus, if you are
editing N different documents, you can have N plus one processes
running at the same time.  If the last process you started was on the
region, the commands described in *Note Debugging:: and *Note Control::
will work on that process, otherwise they will work on the process
associated with the current document.

 - User Option: TeX-region
     The name of the file for temporarily storing the text when
     formatting the current region.

 - User Option: TeX-header-end
     A regular expression matching the end of the header.  By default,
     this is `\begin{document}' in LaTeX mode and `%**end of header' in
     TeX mode.

 - User Option: TeX-trailer-start
     A regular expression matching the start of the trailer.  By
     default, this is `\end{document}' in LaTeX mode and `\bye' in TeX
     mode.

   AUCTeX will try to guess what command you want to invoke, but by
default it will assume that you want to run TeX in TeX mode and LaTeX
in LaTeX mode.  You can overwrite this by setting the variable
`TeX-command-default'.

 - User Option: TeX-command-default
     The default command to run in this buffer.  Must be an entry in
     `TeX-command-list'.

   If you want to overwrite the values of `TeX-header-end',
`TeX-trailer-start', or `TeX-command-default', you can do that for all
files by setting them in either `TeX-mode-hook', `plain-TeX-mode-hook',
or `LaTeX-mode-hook'.  To overwrite them for a single file, define them
as file variables (*note File Variables: (emacs)File Variables.).  You
do this by putting special formatted text near the end of the file.

     %%% Local Variables:
     %%% TeX-header-end: "% End-Of-Header"
     %%% TeX-trailer-start: "% Start-Of-Trailer"
     %%% TeX-command-default: "SliTeX"
     %%% End:

   AUCTeX will try to save any buffers related to the document, and
check if the document needs to be reformatted.  If the variable
`TeX-save-query' is non-nil, AUCTeX will query before saving each file.
By default AUCTeX will check emacs buffers associated with files in
the current directory, in one of the `TeX-macro-private' directories,
and in the `TeX-macro-global' directories.  You can change this by
setting the variable `TeX-check-path'.

 - User Option: TeX-check-path
     Directory path to search for dependencies.

     If nil, just check the current file.  Used when checking if any
     files have changed.


File: auctex,  Node: Viewing,  Next: Debugging,  Prev: Commands,  Up: Running TeX and friends

Viewing the formatted output
============================

AUCTeX allows you to start external programs for previewing your
document.  These are normally invoked by pressing `C-c C-c' once the
document is formatted or via the respective entry in the Command menu.

   AUCTeX will try to guess which type of viewer (DVI, PostScript or
PDF) has to be used and what options are to be passed over to it.  This
decision is based on the output files present in the working directory
as well as the class and style options used in the document.  For
example, if there is a DVI file in your working directory, a DVI viewer
will be invoked.  In case of a PDF file it will be a PDF viewer.  If you
specified a special paper format like `a5paper' or use the `landscape'
option, this will be passed to the viewer by the appropriate options.
Especially some DVI viewers depend on this kind of information in order
to display your document correctly.  In case you are using `pstricks'
or `psfrag' in your document, a DVI viewer cannot display the contents
correctly and a PostScript viewer will be invoked instead.

   The information about which file types and style options are
associated with which viewers and options for them is stored in the
variables `TeX-output-view-style' and `TeX-view-style'.

 - User Option: TeX-output-view-style
     List of output file extensions, style options and view options.

 - User Option: TeX-view-style
     List of style options and view options.  This is the predecessor of
     `TeX-output-view-style' which does not allow the specification of
     output file extensions.  It is used as a fallback in case none of
     the alternatives specified in `TeX-output-view-style' match.  In
     case none of the entries in `TeX-view-style' match either, no
     suggestion for a viewer will be made.

Catching the errors
===================

Once you've formatted your document you may `debug' it, i.e. browse
through the errors (La)TeX reported.

 - Command: TeX-next-error
     (`C-c `')  Go to the next error reported by TeX.  The view will be
     split in two, with the cursor placed as close as possible to the
     error in the top view.  In the bottom view, the error message will
     be displayed along with some explanatory text.

   Normally AUCTeX will only report real errors, but you may as well
ask it to report `bad boxes' as well.

 - Command: TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes
     (`C-c C-w')  Toggle whether AUCTeX should stop at bad boxes (i.e.
     over/under full boxes) as well as at normal errors.

   As default, AUCTeX will display that special `*help*' buffer
containing the error reported by TeX along with the documentation.
There is however an `expert' option, which allows you to display the
real TeX output.

 - User Option: TeX-display-help
     When non-nil AUCTeX will automatically display a help text whenever
     an error is encountered using `TeX-next-error' (`C-c `').


File: auctex,  Node: Checking,  Next: Control,  Prev: Debugging,  Up: Running TeX and friends

Checking for problems
=====================

Running TeX or LaTeX will only find regular errors in the document, not
examples of bad style.  Furthermore, description of the errors may
often be confusing.  The utility `lacheck' can be used to find style
errors, such as forgetting to escape the space after an abbreviation or
using `...' instead of `\ldots' and many other problems like that.  You
start `lacheck' with `C-c C-c C h e c k <RET>'.  The result will be a
list of errors in the `*compilation*' buffer.  You can go through the
errors with `C-x `' (`next-error', *note Compilation:
(emacs)Compilation.), which will move point to the location of the next
error.

   Another newer program which can be used to find errors is `chktex'.
It is much more configurable than `lacheck', but doesn't find all the
problems `lacheck' does, at least in its default configuration.  You
must install the programs before using them, and for `chktex' you must
also modify `TeX-command-list'.  You can get `lacheck' from
`<URL:ftp://ftp.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/lacheck/>' or
alternatively `chktex' from
`<URL:ftp://ftp.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/chktex/>'.  Search for
`chktex' in `tex.el' to see how to switch between them.

Controlling the output
======================

A number of commands are available for controlling the output of an
application running under AUCTeX

 - Command: TeX-kill-job
     (`C-c C-k')  Kill currently running external application.  This
     may be either of TeX, LaTeX, previewer, BibTeX, etc.

 - Command: TeX-recenter-output-buffer
     (`C-c C-l')  Recenter the output buffer so that the bottom line is
     visible.

 - Command: TeX-home-buffer
     (`C-c ^') Go to the `master' file in the document associated with
     the current buffer, or if already there, to the file where the
     current process was started.

Multifile Documents
*******************

You may wish to spread a document over many files (as you are likely to
do if there are multiple authors, or if you have not yet discovered the
power of the outline commands (*note Outline::)).  This can be done by
having a "master" file in which you include the various files with the
TeX macro `\input' or the LaTeX macro `\include'.  These files may also
include other files themselves.  However, to format the document you
must run the commands on the top level master file.

   When you, for example, ask AUCTeX to run a command on the master
file, it has no way of knowing the name of the master file.  By default,
it will assume that the current file is the master file.  If you insert
the following in your `.emacs' file AUCTeX will use a more advanced
algorithm.

     (setq-default TeX-master nil) ; Query for master file.

   If AUCTeX finds the line indicating the end of the header in a master
file (`TeX-header-end'), it can figure out for itself that this is a
master file.  Otherwise, it will ask for the name of the master file
associated with the buffer.  To avoid asking you again, AUCTeX will
automatically insert the name of the master file as a file variable
(*note File Variables: (emacs)File Variables.).  You can also insert
the file variable yourself, by putting the following text at the end of
your files.

     %%% Local Variables:
     %%% TeX-master: "master"
     %%% End:

   You should always set this variable to the name of the top level
document.  If you always use the same name for your top level
documents, you can set `TeX-master' in your `.emacs' file.

     (setq-default TeX-master "master") ; All master files called "master".

 - User Option: TeX-master
     The master file associated with the current buffer.  If the file
     being edited is actually included from another file, then you can
     tell AUCTeX the name of the master file by setting this variable.
     If there are multiple levels of nesting, specify the top level
     file.

     If this variable is `nil', AUCTeX will query you for the name.

     If the variable is `t', then AUCTeX will assume the file is a
     master file itself.

     If the variable is `shared', then AUCTeX will query for the name,
     but will not change the file.

 - User Option: TeX-one-master
     Regular expression matching ordinary TeX files.

     You should set this variable to match the name of all files, for
     which it is a good idea to append a `TeX-master' file variable
     entry automatically.  When AUCTeX adds the name of the master file
     as a file variable, it does not need to ask next time you edit the
     file.

     If you dislike AUCTeX automatically modifying your files, you can
     set this variable to `"<none>"'.  By default, AUCTeX will modify
     any file with an extension of `.tex'.

 - Command: TeX-master-file-ask
     (`C-c _') Query for the name of a master file and add the
     respective File Variables (*note File Variables: (emacs)File
     Variables.) to the file for setting this variable permanently.

     AUCTeX will not ask for a master file when it encounters existing
     files.  This function shall give you the possibility to insert the
     variable manually.

   AUCTeX keeps track of macros, environments, labels, and style files
that are used in a given document.  For this to work with multifile
documents, AUCTeX has to have a place to put the information about the
files in the document.  This is done by having an `auto' subdirectory
placed in the directory where your document is located.  Each time you
save a file, AUCTeX will write information about the file into the
`auto' directory.  When you load a file, AUCTeX will read the
information in the `auto' directory about the file you loaded _and the
master file specified by `TeX-master'_.  Since the master file (perhaps
indirectly) includes all other files in the document, AUCTeX will get
information from all files in the document.  This means that you will
get from each file, for example, completion for all labels defined
anywhere in the document.

   AUC TeX will create the `auto' directory automatically if
`TeX-auto-save' is non-nil.  Without it, the files in the document will
not know anything about each other, except for the name of the master
file.  *Note Automatic Local::.

 - Command: TeX-save-document
     (`C-c C-d') Save all buffers known to belong to the current
     document.

 - User Option: TeX-save-query
     If non-nil, then query the user before saving each file with
     `TeX-save-document'.

Automatic Parsing of TeX files
******************************

AUCTeX depends heavily on being able to extract information from the
buffers by parsing them.  Since parsing the buffer can be somewhat slow,
the parsing is initially disabled.  You are encouraged to enable them by
adding the following lines to your `.emacs' file.

     (setq TeX-parse-self t) ; Enable parse on load.
     (setq TeX-auto-save t) ; Enable parse on save.

   The later command will make AUCTeX store the parsed information in
an `auto' subdirectory in the directory each time the TeX files are
stored, *note Automatic Local::.  If AUCTeX finds the pre-parsed
information when loading a file, it will not need to reparse the buffer.
The information in the `auto' directory is also useful for multifile
documents *note Multifile::, since it allows each file to access the
parsed information from all the other files in the document.  This is
done by first reading the information from the master file, and then
recursively the information from each file stored in the master file.

   The variables can also be done on a per file basis, by changing the
file local variables.

     %%% Local Variables:
     %%% TeX-parse-self: t
     %%% TeX-auto-save: t
     %%% End:

   Even when you have disabled the automatic parsing, you can force the
generation of style information by pressing `C-c C-n'.  This is often
the best choice, as you will be able to decide when it is necessary to
reparse the file.

 - User Option: TeX-parse-self
     Parse file after loading it if no style hook is found for it.

 - User Option: TeX-auto-save
     Automatically save style information when saving the buffer.

 - Command: TeX-normal-mode ARG
     (`C-c C-n') Remove all information about this buffer, and apply the
     style hooks again.  Save buffer first including style information.
     With optional argument, also reload the style hooks.

   When AUCTeX saves your buffer, it can optionally convert all tabs in
your buffer into spaces.  Tabs confuse AUCTeX's error message parsing
and so should generally be avoided.  However, tabs are significant in
some environments, and so by default AUCTeX does not remove them.  To
convert tabs to spaces when saving a buffer, insert the following in
your `.emacs' file:

     (setq TeX-auto-untabify t)

 - User Option: TeX-auto-untabify
     Automatically remove all tabs from a file before saving it.

   Instead of disabling the parsing entirely, you can also speed it
significantly up by limiting the information it will search for (and
store) when parsing the buffer.  You can do this by setting the default
values for the buffer local variables `TeX-auto-regexp-list' and
`TeX-auto-parse-length' in your `.emacs' file.

     ;; Only parse \documentstyle information.
     (setq-default TeX-auto-regexp-list 'LaTeX-auto-minimal-regexp-list)
     ;; The documentstyle command is usually near the beginning.
     (setq-default TeX-auto-parse-length 2000)

   This example will speed the parsing up significantly, but AUCTeX
will no longer be able to provide completion for labels, macros,
environments, or bibitems specified in the document, nor will it know
what files belong to the document.

   These variables can also be specified on a per file basis, by
changing the file local variables.

     %%% Local Variables:
     %%% TeX-auto-regexp-list: TeX-auto-full-regexp-list
     %%% TeX-auto-parse-length: 999999
     %%% End:

 - User Option: TeX-auto-regexp-list
     List of regular expressions used for parsing the current file.

 - User Option: TeX-auto-parse-length
     Maximal length of TeX file that will be parsed.

   The pre-specified lists of regexps are defined below.  You can use
these before loading AUCTeX by quoting them, as in the example above.

 - Constant: TeX-auto-empty-regexp-list
     Parse nothing

 - Constant: LaTeX-auto-minimal-regexp-list
     Only parse documentstyle.

 - Constant: LaTeX-auto-label-regexp-list
     Only parse LaTeX labels.

 - Constant: LaTeX-auto-regexp-list
     Parse common LaTeX commands.

 - Constant: plain-TeX-auto-regexp-list
     Parse common plain TeX commands.

 - Constant: TeX-auto-full-regexp-list
     Parse all TeX and LaTeX commands that AUCTeX can use.

Internationalization
********************

There are several problems associated with editing non-English TeX with
GNU Emacs.  Modern versions of GNU Emacs and TeX are usable for
European (Latin, Cyrillic, Greek) based languages, but special versions
of TeX and Emacs are needed for Korean, Japanese, and Chinese.

* Menu:

* European::                    Using AUCTeX for European languages.
* Japanese::                    Japanese TeX


File: auctex,  Node: European,  Next: Japanese,  Prev: I18n,  Up: I18n

Using AUCTeX for European languages.
====================================

First you will need a way to write non-ASCII characters.  You can either
use macros, or teach TeX about the ISO character sets.  I prefer the
latter, it has the advantage that the usual standard emacs word
movement and case change commands will work.

   With LaTeX2e, just add `\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}'.  Other
languages than Western European ones will probably have other encoding
needs.

   To be able to display non-ASCII characters you will need an
appropriate font and a version of GNU Emacs capable of displaying 8-bit
characters.  The manner in which this is supported differs between
Emacsen, so you need to take a look at your respective documentation.

   A compromise is to use use an European character set when editing the
file, and convert to TeX macros when reading and writing the files.

`iso-cvt.el'
     Much like `iso-tex.el' but is bundled with Emacs 19.23 and later.

`x-compose.el'
     Similar package bundled with new versions of XEmacs.

`X-Symbol'
     a much more complete package for both Emacs and XEmacs that can
     also handle a lot of mathematical characters and input methods.


   AUCTeX supports style files for several languages.  Each style file
may modify some AUCTeX to better support the language, and will run a
language specific hook that will allow you to for example change ispell
dictionary, or run code to change the keyboard remapping.  The
following will for example choose a Danish dictionary for documents
including the `dk.sty' file.  This requires parsing to be enabled,
*note Parsing Files::.

     (add-hook 'TeX-language-dk-hook
     	  (function (lambda () (ispell-change-dictionary "danish"))))

   The following style files are recognized.
`dk'
     Runs style hook `TeX-language-dk-hook'.

`dutch'
     Runs style hook `TeX-language-nl-hook'.

`german'
     Runs style hook `TeX-language-de-hook'.  Gives  `"' word syntax
     and makes the <"> key insert a literal `"'.

`plfonts'
`plhb'
     Runs style hook `TeX-language-pl-hook'.  Gives  `"' word syntax
     and makes the <"> key insert a literal `"'.  Pressing <"> twice
     will insert `"<' or `">' depending on context.

`italian'
     Runs style hook `TeX-language-it-hook'.  Pressing <"> will insert
     `' or `' depending on context.

Japanese TeX
============

To write Japanese text with AUCTeX you need to have versions of TeX and
Emacs that support Japanese.  There exist at least two variants of TeX
for Japanese text (jTeX and pTeX), and AUCTeX can be used with MULE
supported Emacsens.

   To install Japanese support for AUCTeX, copy `tex-jp.el' to AUCTeX
installed directory.  Next two commands will automatically install
contributed files.

     make contrib
     make install-contrib

   See `INSTALL' and `Makefile' for more information.

   To use the Japanese TeX variants, simply enter `japanese-tex-mode',
`japanese-latex-mode', or `japanese-slitex-mode', and everything should
work.  If not, send mail to Shinji Kobayashi
`<koba@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>', who kindly donated the code for supporting
Japanese in AUCTeX.  None of the primary AUCTeX maintainers understand
Japanese, so they can not help you.

   If you usually use AUCTeX in Japanese, setting following variables
is useful.

 - User Option: TeX-default-mode
     Mode to enter for a new file when it can't be determined whether
     the file is plain TeX or LaTeX or what.

     To use Japanese TeX always, set japanese command for example:
          (setq TeX-default-mode 'japanese-latex-mode)

 - User Option: japanese-TeX-command-default
     The default command for TeX-command in japanese TeX mode.

     The default value is `jTeX'.

 - User Option: japanese-LaTeX-command-default
     The default command for TeX-command in japanese LaTeX mode.

     The default value is `jLaTeX'.

 - User Option: japanese-LaTeX-default-style
     The default style/class when creating new japanese LaTeX document.

     The default value is `j-article'.

   See `tex-jp.el' for more information.

Automatic Customization
***********************

Since AUCTeX is so highly customizable, it makes sense that it is able
to customize itself.  The automatic customization consists of scanning
TeX files and extracting symbols, environments, and things like that.

   The automatic customization is done on three different levels.  The
global level is the level shared by all users at your site, and consists
of scanning the standard TeX style files, and any extra styles added
locally for all users on the site.  The private level deals with those
style files you have written for your own use, and use in different
documents.  You may have a `~/lib/TeX/' directory where you store
useful style files for your own use.  The local level is for a specific
directory, and deals with writing customization for the files for your
normal TeX documents.

   If compared with the environment variable `TEXINPUTS', the global
level corresponds to the directories built into TeX.  The private level
corresponds to the directories you add yourself, except for `.', which
is the local level.

* Menu:

* Automatic Global::            Automatic Customization for the Site
* Automatic Private::           Automatic Customization for a User
* Automatic Local::             Automatic Customization for a Directory

   By default AUCTeX will search for customization files in all the
global, private, and local style directories, but you can also set the
path directly.  This is useful if you for example want to add another
person's style hooks to your path.  Please note that all matching files
found in `TeX-style-path' are loaded, and all hooks defined in the
files will be executed.

 - User Option: TeX-style-path
     List of directories to search for AUCTeX style files.  Each must
     end with a slash.

   By default, when AUCTeX searches a directory for files, it will
recursively search through subdirectories.

 - User Option: TeX-file-recurse
     Whether to search TeX directories recursively: nil means do not
     recurse, a positive integer means go that far deep in the directory
     hierarchy, t means recurse indefinitely.

   By default, AUCTeX will ignore files name `.', `..', `SCCS', `RCS',
and `CVS'.

 - User Option: TeX-ignore-file
     Regular expression matching file names to ignore.

     These files or directories will not be considered when searching
     for TeX files in a directory.

Automatic Customization for the Site
====================================

Assuming that the automatic customization at the global level was done
when AUCTeX was installed, your choice is now: will you use it?  If you
use it, you will benefit by having access to all the symbols and
environments available for completion purposes.  The drawback is slower
load time when you edit a new file and perhaps too many confusing
symbols when you try to do a completion.

   You can disable the automatic generated global style hooks by setting
the variable `TeX-auto-global' to nil.

 - User Option: TeX-macro-global
     Directories containing the site's TeX style files.

 - User Option: TeX-style-global
     Directory containing hand generated TeX information.  Must end
     with a slash.

     These correspond to TeX macros shared by all users of a site.

 - User Option: TeX-auto-global
     Directory containing automatically generated information.

     For storing automatic extracted information about the TeX macros
     shared by all users of a site.


File: auctex,  Node: Automatic Private,  Next: Automatic Local,  Prev: Automatic Global,  Up: Automatic

Automatic Customization for a User
==================================

You should specify where you store your private TeX macros, so AUCTeX
can extract their information.  The extracted information will go to
the directories listed in `TeX-auto-private'

   Use `M-x TeX-auto-generate' to extract the information.

 - User Option: TeX-macro-private
     Directories where you store your personal TeX macros.  Each must
     end with a slash.

     This defaults to the directories listed in the `TEXINPUTS' and
     `BIBINPUTS' environment variables.

 - User Option: TeX-auto-private
     List of directories containing automatically generated information.
     Must end with a slash.

     These correspond to the personal TeX macros.

 - Command: TeX-auto-generate TEX AUTO
     (`M-x TeX-auto-generate') Generate style hook for TEX and store it
     in AUTO.  If TEX is a directory, generate style hooks for all
     files in the directory.

 - User Option: TeX-style-private
     List of directories containing hand generated information.  Must
     end with a slash.

     These correspond to the personal TeX macros.


File: auctex,  Node: Automatic Local,  Prev: Automatic Private,  Up: Automatic

Automatic Customization for a Directory
=======================================

AUCTeX can update the style information about a file each time you save
it, and it will do this if the directory `TeX-auto-local' exist.
`TeX-auto-local' is by default set to `"auto/"', so simply creating an
`auto' directory will enable automatic saving of style information.

   The advantage of doing this is that macros, labels, etc. defined in
any file in a multifile document will be known in all the files in the
document.  The disadvantage is that saving will be slower.  To disable,
set `TeX-auto-local' to nil.

 - User Option: TeX-style-local
     Directory containing hand generated TeX information.  Must end
     with a slash.

     These correspond to TeX macros found in the current directory.

 - User Option: TeX-auto-local
     Directory containing automatically generated TeX information.
     Must end with a slash.

     These correspond to TeX macros found in the current directory.

A Simple Style File
===================

Here is a simple example of a style file.

     ;;; book.el - Special code for book style.
     
     (TeX-add-style-hook "book"
      (function (lambda () (setq LaTeX-largest-level
     			    (LaTeX-section-level ("chapter"))))))

   This file specifies that the largest kind of section in a LaTeX
document using the book document style is chapter.  The interesting
thing to notice is that the style file defines an (anonymous) function,
and adds it to the list of loaded style hooks by calling
`TeX-add-style-hook'.

   The first time the user indirectly tries to access some style
specific information, such as the largest sectioning command available,
the style hooks for all files directly or indirectly read by the
current document is executed.  The actual files will only be evaluated
once, but the hooks will be called for each buffer using the style file.

 - Function: TeX-add-style-hook STYLE HOOK
     Add HOOK to the list of functions to run when we use the TeX file
     STYLE.


File: auctex,  Node: Adding Macros,  Next: Adding Environments,  Prev: Simple Style,  Up: Style Files

Adding Support for Macros
=========================

The most common thing to define in a style hook is new symbols (TeX
macros).  Most likely along with a description of the arguments to the
function, since the symbol itself can be defined automatically.

   Here are a few examples from `latex.el'.

     (TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
      (function
       (lambda ()
          (TeX-add-symbols
          '("arabic" TeX-arg-counter)
          '("label" TeX-arg-define-label)
          '("ref" TeX-arg-label)
          '("newcommand" TeX-arg-define-macro [ "Number of arguments" ] t)
          '("newtheorem" TeX-arg-define-environment
            [ TeX-arg-environment "Numbered like" ]
            t [ TeX-arg-counter "Within counter" ])))))

 - Function: TeX-add-symbols SYMBOL ...
     Add each SYMBOL to the list of known symbols.

   Each argument to `TeX-add-symbols' is a list describing one symbol.
The head of the list is the name of the symbol, the remaining elements
describe each argument.

   If there are no additional elements, the symbol will be inserted with
point inside braces.  Otherwise, each argument of this function should
match an argument of the TeX macro.  What is done depends on the
argument type.

   If a macro is defined multiple times, AUCTeX will chose the one with
the longest definition (i.e. the one with the most arguments).

   Thus, to overwrite
     	'("tref" 1) ; one argument
   you can specify
     	'("tref" TeX-arg-label ignore) ; two arguments

   `ignore' is a function that does not do anything, so when you insert
a `tref' you will be prompted for a label and no more.

`string'
     Use the string as a prompt to prompt for the argument.

`number'
     Insert that many braces, leave point inside the first.

`nil'
     Insert empty braces.

`t'
     Insert empty braces, leave point between the braces.

`other symbols'
     Call the symbol as a function.  You can define your own hook, or
     use one of the predefined argument hooks.

`list'
     If the car is a string, insert it as a prompt and the next element
     as initial input.  Otherwise, call the car of the list with the
     remaining elements as arguments.

`vector'
     Optional argument.  If it has more than one element, parse it as a
     list, otherwise parse the only element as above.  Use square
     brackets instead of curly braces, and is not inserted on empty user
     input.

   A lot of argument hooks have already been defined.  The first
argument to all hooks is a flag indicating if it is an optional
argument.  It is up to the hook to determine what to do with the
remaining arguments, if any.  Typically the next argument is used to
overwrite the default prompt.

`TeX-arg-conditional'
     Implements if EXPR THEN ELSE.  If EXPR evaluates to true, parse
     THEN as an argument list, else parse ELSE as an argument list.

`TeX-arg-literal'
     Insert its arguments into the buffer.  Used for specifying extra
     syntax for a macro.

`TeX-arg-free'
     Parse its arguments but use no braces when they are inserted.

`TeX-arg-eval'
     Evaluate arguments and insert the result in the buffer.

`TeX-arg-file'
     Prompt for a tex or sty filename, and use it without the
     extension. Run the file hooks defined for it.

`TeX-arg-label'
     Prompt for a label completing with known labels.

`TeX-arg-macro'
     Prompt for a TeX macro with completion.

`TeX-arg-environment'
     Prompt for a LaTeX environment with completion.

`TeX-arg-cite'
     Prompt for a BibTeX citation.

`TeX-arg-counter'
     Prompt for a LaTeX counter.

`TeX-arg-savebox'
     Prompt for a LaTeX savebox.

`TeX-arg-file'
     Prompt for a filename in the current directory, and use it without
     the extension.

`TeX-arg-input-file'
     Prompt for a filename in the current directory, and use it without
     the extension.  Run the style hooks for the file.

`TeX-arg-define-label'
     Prompt for a label completing with known labels.  Add label to
     list of defined labels.

`TeX-arg-define-macro'
     Prompt for a TeX macro with completion.  Add macro to list of
     defined macros.

`TeX-arg-define-environment'
     Prompt for a LaTeX environment with completion.  Add environment to
     list of defined environments.

`TeX-arg-define-cite'
     Prompt for a BibTeX citation.

`TeX-arg-define-counter'
     Prompt for a LaTeX counter.

`TeX-arg-define-savebox'
     Prompt for a LaTeX savebox.

`TeX-arg-corner'
     Prompt for a LaTeX side or corner position with completion.

`TeX-arg-lr'
     Prompt for a LaTeX side with completion.

`TeX-arg-tb'
     Prompt for a LaTeX side with completion.

`TeX-arg-pagestyle'
     Prompt for a LaTeX pagestyle with completion.

`TeX-arg-verb'
     Prompt for delimiter and text.

`TeX-arg-pair'
     Insert a pair of numbers, use arguments for prompt. The numbers are
     surrounded by parentheses and separated with a comma.

`TeX-arg-size'
     Insert width and height as a pair.  No arguments.

`TeX-arg-coordinate'
     Insert x and y coordinates as a pair.  No arguments.

   If you add new hooks, you can assume that point is placed directly
after the previous argument, or after the macro name if this is the
first argument.  Please leave point located after the argument you are
inserting.  If you want point to be located somewhere else after all
hooks have been processed, set the value of `exit-mark'.  It will point
nowhere, until the argument hook sets it.

Adding Support for Environments
===============================

Adding support for environments is very much like adding support for
TeX macros, except that each environment normally only takes one
argument, an environment hook.  The example is again a short version of
`latex.el'.

     (TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
      (function
       (lambda ()
         (LaTeX-add-environments
          '("document" LaTeX-env-document)
          '("enumerate" LaTeX-env-item)
          '("itemize" LaTeX-env-item)
          '("list" LaTeX-env-list)))))

   The only hook that is generally useful is `LaTeX-env-item', which is
used for environments that contain items.  It is completely up to the
environment hook to insert the environment, but the function
`LaTeX-insert-environment' may be of some help.  The hook will be
called with the name of the environment as its first argument, and extra
arguments can be provided by adding them to a list after the hook.

   For simple environments with arguments, for example defined with
`\newenvironment', you can make AUCTeX prompt for the arguments by
giving the prompt strings in the call to `LaTeX-add-environments'.  For
example, if you have defined a `loop' environment with the three
arguments FROM, TO, and STEP, you can add support for them in a style
file.

     %% loop.sty
     
     \newenvironment{loop}[3]{...}{...}

     ;; loop.el
     
     (TeX-add-style-hook "loop"
      (function
       (lambda ()
         (LaTeX-add-environments
          '("loop" "From" "To" "Step")))))

   If an environment is defined multiple times, AUCTeX will chose the
one with the longest definition.  Thus, if you have an enumerate style
file, and want it to replace the standard LaTeX enumerate hook above,
you could define an `enumerate.el' file as follows, and place it in the
appropriate style directory.

     (TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
      (function
       (lambda ()
         (LaTeX-add-environments
          '("enumerate" LaTeX-env-enumerate foo)))))
     
     (defun LaTeX-env-enumerate (environment &optional ignore) ...)

   The symbol `foo' will be passed to `LaTeX-env-enumerate' as the
second argument, but since we only added it to overwrite the definition
in `latex.el' it is just ignored.

 - Function: LaTeX-add-environments ENV ...
     Add each ENV to list of loaded environments.

 - Function: LaTeX-insert-environment ENV [ EXTRA ]
     Insert environment of type ENV, with optional argument EXTRA.

Adding Other Information
========================

You can also specify bibliographical databases and labels in the style
file.  This is probably of little use, since this information will
usually be automatically generated from the TeX file anyway.

 - Function: LaTeX-add-bibliographies BIBLIOGRAPHY ...
     Add each BIBLIOGRAPHY to list of loaded bibliographies.

 - Function: LaTeX-add-labels LABEL ...
     Add each LABEL to the list of known labels.


File: auctex,  Node: Hacking the Parser,  Prev: Adding Other,  Up: Style Files

Automatic Extraction of New Things
==================================

The automatic TeX information extractor works by searching for regular
expressions in the TeX files, and storing the matched information.  You
can add support for new constructs to the parser, something that is
needed when you add new commands to define symbols.

   For example, in the file `macro.tex' I define the following macro.

     \newcommand{\newmacro}[5]{%
     \def#1{#3\index{#4@#5~cite{#4}}\nocite{#4}}%
     \def#2{#5\index{#4@#5~cite{#4}}\nocite{#4}}%
     }

   AUCTeX will automatically figure out that `newmacro' is a macro that
takes five arguments.  However, it is not smart enough to automatically
see that each time we use the macro, two new macros are defined.  We
can specify this information in a style hook file.

     ;;; macro.el - Special code for my own macro file.
     
     ;;; Code:
     
     (defvar TeX-newmacro-regexp
       '("\\\\newmacro{\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}{\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}"
         (1 2) TeX-auto-multi)
       "Matches \newmacro definitions.")
     
     (defvar TeX-auto-multi nil
       "Temporary for parsing \\newmacro definitions.")
     
     (defun TeX-macro-cleanup ()
       ;; Move symbols from `TeX-auto-multi' to `TeX-auto-symbol'.
       (mapcar (function (lambda (list)
     	    (mapcar (function (lambda (symbol)
     		      (setq TeX-auto-symbol
     			    (cons symbol TeX-auto-symbol))))
     		    list)))
     	  TeX-auto-multi))
     
     (defun TeX-macro-prepare ()
       ;; Clear `Tex-auto-multi' before use.
       (setq TeX-auto-multi nil))
     
     (add-hook 'TeX-auto-prepare-hook 'TeX-macro-prepare)
     (add-hook 'TeX-auto-cleanup-hook 'TeX-macro-cleanup)
     
     (TeX-add-style-hook "macro"
      (function
       (lambda ()
         (TeX-auto-add-regexp TeX-newmacro-regexp)
         (TeX-add-symbols '("newmacro"
     		       TeX-arg-macro
     		       (TeX-arg-macro "Capitalized macro: \\")
     		       t
     		       "BibTeX entry: "
     		       nil)))))
     
     ;;; macro.el ends here

   When this file is first loaded, it adds a new entry to
`TeX-newmacro-regexp', and defines a function to be called before the
parsing starts, and one to be called after the parsing is done.  It
also declares a variable to contain the data collected during parsing.
Finally, it adds a style hook which describes the `newmacro' macro, as
we have seen it before.

   So the general strategy is: Add a new entry to `TeX-newmacro-regexp'.
Declare a variable to contain intermediate data during parsing.  Add
hook to be called before and after parsing.  In this case, the hook
before parsing just initializes the variable, and the hook after parsing
collects the data from the variable, and adds them to the list of
symbols found.

 - Variable: TeX-auto-regexp-list
     List of regular expressions matching TeX macro definitions.

     The list has the following format ((REGEXP MATCH TABLE) ...), that
     is, each entry is a list with three elements.

     REGEXP.  Regular expression matching the macro we want to parse.

     MATCH.  A number or list of numbers, each representing one
     parenthesized subexpression matched by REGEXP.

     TABLE.  The symbol table to store the data.  This can be a
     function, in which case the function is called with the argument
     MATCH.  Use `TeX-match-buffer' to get match data.  If it is not a
     function, it is presumed to be the name of a variable containing a
     list of match data.  The matched data (a string if MATCH is a
     number, a list of strings if MATCH is a list of numbers) is put in
     front of the table.

 - Variable: TeX-auto-prepare-hook nil
     List of functions to be called before parsing a TeX file.

 - Variable: TeX-auto-cleanup-hook nil
     List of functions to be called after parsing a TeX file.

How to install AUCTeX
*********************

Installing AUCTeX should be simple: merely `./configure', `make', and
`make install'. This does not yet activate the package, but merely
makes it available. See *Note Loading the package:: for the activation.
Please read through this document fully before installing anything.

* Menu:

* Prerequisites::
* Configure::
* Build/install::
* Loading the package::
* Advice for package providers::
* Advice for non-privileged users::
* Installation under MS Windows::
* Customizing::


File: auctex,  Node: Prerequisites,  Next: Configure,  Up: Installation

Prerequisites
=============

   * A recent version of Emacs 20 or 21, alternatively XEmacs 20 or 21

     There is additional information for Windows installations in *Note
     Installation under MS Windows::.

   * A working LaTeX installation

     This is not really needed to _install_ the package, but will be
     required for useful operation of it. The elisp of AUCTeX will
     probably run without LaTeX, but you will find relatively little
     use for it.

   * The `texinfo' package

     This is needed for building the documentation. If you don't have
     this, or you have a too old version of it (try building and you'll
     find out), you may download a separate tar file with the prebuilt
     documentation from Savannah and install it over the main unpacked
     tar archive.


File: auctex,  Node: Configure,  Next: Build/install,  Prev: Prerequisites,  Up: Installation

Configure
=========

The first step is to configure the source code, telling it where
various files will be.  To do so, run

     ./configure OPTIONS

   (Note: if you have fetched AUCTeX from CVS rather than a regular
release, you will have to first generate `./configure' by running
`autogen.sh' in the `auctex' directory.)

   On many machines, you will not need to specify any options, but if
`configure' cannot determine something on its own, you'll need to help
it out with one of these options:

`--with-emacs[=/PATH/TO/EMACS]'
     If you are using a pretest which isn't in your `$PATH', or
     `configure' is not finding the right Emacs executable, you can
     specify it with this option.

`--with-xemacs[=/PATH/TO/XEMACS]'
     Configure for generation under XEmacs (Emacs is the default).
     Again, the name of the right XEmacs executable can be specified,
     complete with path if necessary.

`--with-lispdir=/DIR'
     This tells where to install Emacs Lisp files.  Normally, this
     option is unnecessary, but may be used if you don't like the
     directory that configure is suggesting.

`--with-packagedir=/DIR'
     This tells where to install the XEmacs Package.  Again, this
     option is normally unnecessary, but may be used if you don't like
     the directory that configure is suggesting, and you know that
     XEmacs regards the directory you specify as a package directory.

     If you are installing AUCTeX for a single user, and you have
     installed no XEmacs packages as that user before, then `configure'
     may try to install AUCTeX in the systemwide package directory
     (that it cannot write to), causing installation to fail.  In that
     case, a good value for this option is `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages',
     as XEmacs looks there for per-user packages by default.

`--with-texmf-dir=/DIR'
     This option can be used to specify the location of the TeX TDS
     directory hierarchy resides. It is not necessary for most TeX
     installs, but may be used if you don't like the directory that
     configure is suggesting.

`--help'
     This is not an option specific to AUCTeX. A number of standard
     options to `configure' exist, and we do not have the room to
     describe them here; a short description of each is available, using
     `--help'.



File: auctex,  Node: Build/install,  Next: Loading the package,  Prev: Configure,  Up: Installation

Build/install
=============

Once `configure' has been run, simply enter

     make

at the prompt to byte-compile the lisp files, and build the
documentation files. To install the files into the locations chosen
earlier, type

     make install

You may need special privileges to install, e.g., if you are installing
into system directories.


File: auctex,  Node: Loading the package,  Next: Advice for package providers,  Prev: Build/install,  Up: Installation

Loading the package
===================

First you should make sure that AUCTeX gets loaded.  You then need to
place a few lines in your personal `.emacs' file (or a site-wide
configuration file).

   For XEmacs, if you specified a valid package directory during
installation, or none at all, then XEmacs installation should do
everything necessary in order to install AUCTeX as a package and
activate it.  Restarting XEmacs should then make the package visible,
and `C-c C-c' should give you a command prompt.

   If you used `--with-packagedir', you have to make sure that the
directory `lisp/auctex' under the directory you specified is in XEmacs'
`load-path' variable.

   For GNU Emacs, the recommended way to activate AUCTeX is to add the
following line to your `.emacs' file:

     (require 'tex-site)

   If you used `--with-lispdir', you have to make sure that the
directory specified is in Emacs' `load-path' variable, so that you
would instead use, e.g.,

     (setq load-path (cons "~/elisp" load-path))
     (require 'tex-site)

   For site-wide activation in GNU Emacs, see *Note Advice for package
providers::.

   That is all.  There are other ways of achieving the equivalent thing,
but we don't mention them here any more since they are not better, and
people got confused into trying everything at once.


File: auctex,  Node: Advice for package providers,  Next: Advice for non-privileged users,  Prev: Loading the package,  Up: Installation

Providing AUCTeX as a package
=============================

As a package provider, you should make sure that your users will be
served best according to their intentions, and keep in mind that a
system might be used by more than one user, with different preferences.
The use of packages should in general not impact performance negatively
if a user chooses not to employ it, but should be as convenient as
possible. The policy with regard to AUCTeX has been to _refrain_ from
activating it automatically when it is installed as a package. This is
reasonable because

   * Emacs comes with a simpler default TeX mode with different
     keybindings.  Some users might prefer that.

   * AUCTeX is activated via `(require 'tex-site)'.  Once this has
     happened, it is not possible to get back the original TeX mode.  A
     site-wide default would for this reason be hard to override.

   If, however, you are certain that the users all prefer AUCTeX, you
may place the following line in `default.el':

     (require 'tex-site)

   XEmacs uses a package system.  The default AUCTeX installation
should cater for everything necessary in that case.


File: auctex,  Node: Advice for non-privileged users,  Next: Installation under MS Windows,  Prev: Advice for package providers,  Up: Installation

Installation for non-privileged users
=====================================

Often people without system administration privileges want to install
software for their private use.  In that case you need to specify more
options top the `configure' script.  For XEmacs users, this is fairly
easy, because the XEmacs package system has been designed to make this
sort of thing practical: but GNU Emacs users (and XEmacs users for whom
the package system is for some reason misbehaving) may need to do a
little more work.

   GNU Emacs users can solve this problem by using the `--prefix'
option to the `configure' script, and let it point to the personal home
directory.  In that way, resulting binaries will be installed under the
`bin' subdirectory of your home directory, manual pages under `man' and
so on.  That way, it is reasonably easy to maintain a bunch of
additional packages, since the prefix argument is supported by most
`configure' scripts.

   You'll have to add something like
`/home/myself/share/emacs/site-lisp' to your `load-path' variable, if
it isn't there already.

   XEmacs users can achieve the same end by pointing `configure' at an
appropriate package directory (normally
`--with-packagedir=~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages' will serve).  This should
only need to be done once, and should be needed fairly rarely; if you
have installed any personal XEmacs packages before, `configure' should
detect that, and automatically install AUCTeX there too; equally, if
you have installed AUCTeX somewhere searched by XEmacs, AUCTeX should
be automatically reinstalled over that copy.

   (`configure' may guess wrong if the site administrator has installed
AUCTeX somewhere else: if so, just use the `--with-packagedir' option
to override `configure''s choice.)

   But there is another problem: perhaps you want to make it easy for
other users to share parts of your personal Emacs configuration.  In
general, you can do this by writing `~myself/' anywhere where you
specify paths to something installed in your personal subdirectories,
not merely `~/', since the latter, when used by other users, will point
to non-existent files.

   For yourself, it will do to manipulate environment variables in your
`.profile' resp. `.login' files.  But if people will be copying just
Elisp files, their copies will not work.  While it would in general be
preferable if the added components where available from a shell level,
too (like when you call the standalone info reader, or try using
`preview.sty' for functionality besides of Emacs previews), it will be
a big help already if things work from inside of Emacs.

   Here is how to do the various parts:

Making the Elisp available
--------------------------

In XEmacs, you should ask the other users to add symbolic links in their
`~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/lisp', `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/info' and
`~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/etc' directories. (Alas, there is presently
no easy programmatic way to do this, except to have a script do the
symlinking for them.)

   In GNU Emacs, you'll want the invocation lines described in *Note
Loading the package::.  In addition, you'll want a line such as

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~myself/share/emacs/site-lisp/preview")

Making the Info files available
-------------------------------

While for yourself, you'll probably want to manipulate the `INFOPATH'
variable; for access inside of Elisp something like the following might
be convenient:

     (eval-after-load 'info
        '(add-to-list 'Info-directory-list "~myself/info"))

   In XEmacs, as long as XEmacs can see the package, there should be no
need to do anything at all; the info files should be immediately
visible.  However, you might want to set `INFOPATH' anyway, for the
sake of standalone readers outside of XEmacs. (The info files in XEmacs
are normally in `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/info'.)


File: auctex,  Node: Installation under MS Windows,  Next: Customizing,  Prev: Advice for non-privileged users,  Up: Installation

Installation under MS Windows
=============================

Installation of AUCTeX is a bit more complicated, but we are working to
resolve the issues involved. Please report success/failure to us at
`auc-tex@sunsite.dk'. Here are the steps to perform:

  1. The installation of AUCTeX will require the MSYS tool set from
     `http://www.mingw.org'. If you have the Cygwin tool set from
     `http://cygwin.com' installed, that should do just fine as well,
     but it is quite larger and slower. If you need to compile
     Emacs/XEmacs from source, you'll also need compilers and stuff
     that are also available for both of those tool sets. Compiling
     Emacs is outside of the scope of this manual: good luck. AUCTeX
     itself does not require a C compiler for installation. Without
     either of those tool sets, however, you would need to generate
     your various `Makefile' copies from the respective `Makefile.in'
     files by hand, and that would mean quite a lot of guesswork. There
     is no sense going into too much details here: the instructions
     would change severely between versions, and the above tool sets
     are easy enough to acquire to make manual configuration
     unnecessary.

  2. Install GNU Emacs from `http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/windows/emacs/'
     or XEmacs from `http://www.xemacs.org'.

  3. You need a working TeX installation.  One popular installation
     under Windows is MikTeX (http://www.miktex.org).  Another much more
     extensive system is TeX live (http://www.tug.org/texlive) which is
     rather close to its Unix cousins.

  4. Now the fun stuff starts. Unpack the AUCTeX distribution into some
     installation directory. *Do not* unpack it right into your Emacs'
     own directories: the installation will copy the material that
     needs to be placed there. Keep the installation directory
     separate: you can remove its contents after installation
     completes. Since you are reading this, you probably have already
     unpacked AUCTeX, but it should still be easy to move it elsewhere
     now.

  5. Ready for takeoff. Start some shell (typically `bash') capable of
     running `configure', change into the installation directory and
     call `./configure' with appropriate options.

     Typical options you'll want to specify will be
    `--with-emacs'
          if you are installing Emacs. You can use
          `--with-emacs=/PATH/TO/EMACS' to specify the name of the
          installed Emacs executable, complete with its path if
          necessary (if Emacs is not within a directory specified in
          your PATH environment setting).

    `--with-xemacs'
          If you are using XEmacs, of course use `--with-xemacs' in the
          same manner.

    `--with-texmf-dir=DIR'
          This will specify the directory where your TeX installation
          sits. If your TeX installation does not conform to the TDS
          (TeX directory standard), you may need to specify more
          options to get everything in place. See *Note Configure:: for
          more information about the available options.

    `--with-lispdir=/DIR'
          This may be needed for GNU Emacs installation, but hopefully
          `configure' should figure this out by itself. Don't use this
          for XEmacs, rather use

    `--with-packagedir=/DIR'
          which gives the location of the package directory for XEmacs
          where stuff should be installed. Again, hopefully this is not
          necessary to specify.

  6. If you need to use the prebuilt documentation (see above), now is
     the time to unpack it over the rest of the installation directory.

  7. Run `make' in the installation directory (we have had one report
     that Emacs did not manage to byte compile the Elisp files, and
     that had to be done by hand.  No idea about what might have gone
     wrong there).

  8. Run `make install' in the installation directory.

  9. For GNU Emacs, the recommended way to activate AUCTeX is to add the
     following line to your `.emacs' file:

          (require 'tex-site)

 10. Load a `.tex' file Emacs or XEmacs and see if you get the
     `Command' menu. Try using that to LaTeX the file.

        Well, that about is all.  Have fun!


File: auctex,  Node: Customizing,  Prev: Installation under MS Windows,  Up: Installation

Customizing
===========

Next, you should edit the file `tex-site.el' to fit your local site.
You do this by looking at the customization section in the beginning of
`tex.el' and copy the definitions that are wrong for your site to
`tex-site.el'. Do _not_ edit `tex.el' directly, or you will have to do
all the work over again when you upgrade AUCTeX. AUCTeX will not
overwrite your old `tex-site.el' file next time you install, so you
will be able to keep all your customizations.

   There are two variables with a special significance.

 - User Option: TeX-lisp-directory
     The directory where you installed the AUCTeX lisp files.

   This variable is set automatically by the `make install' command.
If you don't issue a `make install', for example if you don't want to
install AUCTeX in a different place, you will have to set this variable
manually to the location of the compiled files.

 - User Option: TeX-macro-global
     Directories containing the site's TeX style files.

   Normally, AUCTeX will only allow you to complete a short list of
built-in macros and environments and on the macros you define yourself.
If you issue the `M-x TeX-auto-generate-global' command after loading
AUCTeX, you will be able to complete on all macros available in the
standard style files used by your document. To do this, you must set
this variable to a list of directories where the standard style files
are located. The directories will be searched recursively, so there is
no reason to list subsirectories explicitly.

   You probably also need to change `TeX-command-list' to make sure
that the commands used for starting TeX, printing, etc. work on your
system.  Copy the definition from `tex.el' to `tex-site.el' and edit
the command names appropriately.

   Finally, copy and edit `TeX-printer-list' to contain the printers
available at your site.

   To extract information from your sites TeX macros, type `M-x
TeX-auto-generate-global' in your emacs.  This will only work if you
have set `TeX-macro-global' correctly in `tex-site.el'.

Contributed files
=================

There are several files that are not part of AUCTeX proper, but
included in the distribution in case they are useful.

`bib-cite.el'
     Better support for bibliographies and much more.

`tex-jp.el'
     Support for Japanese.

The History of AUCTeX
*********************

See the file `history.texi' for older changes.

News in 12
==========

   * The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain TeX,
     LaTeX, ConTeXt etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
     `TeX-command-menu' has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
     and the customization will not work correctly.

   * If `TeX-master' is set to `t', AUCTeX will now query for a master
     file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
     alone.  The new function `TeX-master-file-ask' is provided for
     adding the variable manually.

   * Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font.  The variable
     `font-latex-title-fontity' can be customized to restore the old
     appearance, i.e. the usage of a different color instead of a
     change in size.

   * Support for `alphanum.sty', `beamer.cls', `booktabs.sty',
     `emp.sty' and `paralist.sty' was added.

   * AUCTeX may now be customized to fontify either >>German<< or
     <<French>> quotes by changing the variable `font-latex-quotes'.

   * Certain TeX/LaTeX function, reference, variable and warning
     keywords will now be fontified.  Own keywords may be added by
     customizing the variables `font-latex-match-function-keywords',
     `font-latex-match-reference-keywords',
     `font-latex-match-variable-keywords' and
     `font-latex-match-warning-keywords'.

   * If you include the style files `german' or `ngerman' in a document
     (directly or via the `babel' package), you should now customize
     `LaTeX-german-open-quote', `LaTeX-german-close-quote' and
     `LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote' instead of `TeX-open-quote',
     `TeX-close-quote' and `TeX-quote-after-quote' if you want to
     influence the type of quote insertion.

   * AUCTeX now includes support for ConTeXt.

   * AUCTeX now is able to determine automatically which viewer to
     choose and what parameters to pass to it by looking at the
     extension of the output file and certain options used in the
     source file.  The behavior can be adapted or extended respectively
     by customizing the variable `TeX-output-view-style'.

   * `TeX-run-discard' is now able to completely detach a process that
     it started.

   * The build process was enhanced and is now based on `autoconf'.

   * Support for the KOMA-Script classes.  Contributed by Mark Trettin
     <Mark.Trettin@gmx.de>.

   * Many more LaTeX and LaTeX2e commands are supported.  Done by
     Masayuki Ataka  <ataka@milk.freemail.ne.jp>

   * Support for `prosper.sty', see <http://prosper.sourceforge.net/>.
     Contributed by Phillip Lord <p.lord@russet.org.uk>.

   * You can now switch between using the `font-latex' (all emacsen),
     the `tex-font' (Emacs 21 only) or no special package for font
     locking.  Customize `TeX-install-font-lock' for this.

   * Now use -t landscape by default when landscape option appears.
     Suggested by Erik Frisk <frisk@isy.liu.se>.

ToDo
****

The following sections describe future development of AUCTeX.  Besides
mid-term goals, bug reports and requests we cannot fix or honor right
away are being gathered here.  If you have some time for Emacs Lisp
hacking, you are encouraged to try to provide a solution to one of the
following problems.  It might be a good idea to discuss proposed
changes on the mailing list of AUCTeX first.

Mid-term Goals
==============

   * Integration of preview-latex into AUCTeX

     AUCTeX users will thereby get the functionality provided by
     preview-latex without the hassle of an additional installation.

     Looking at the backend, the integration involves folding of error
     parsing and task management of both packages which will ease
     development efforts and avoid redundant work.

   * More flexible option and command handling

     The current state of command handling with `TeX-command-list' is
     not very flexible because there is no distinction between
     executables and command line options to be passed to them.  This
     is problematic if macro processors should be called with
     dynamically determined options.  Additionally, the current scheme
     does not allow changes in command handling without possibly
     breaking customizations made by users.  A new scheme will
     facilitate the (automatic) customization of macro processors and
     viewers at install time as well.

Wishlist
========

   * Page count when compiling should (optionally) go to modeline of the
     window where the compilation command was invoked, instead of the
     output window.  Suggested by Karsten Tinnefeld
     <tinnefeld@irb.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>.

   * Command to insert a macrodefinition in the preamble, without moving
     point from the current location.  Suggested by "Jeffrey C. Ely"
     <ely@nwu.edu>.

   * A way to add and overwrite math mode entries in style files, and to
     decide where they should be.  Suggested by Remo Badii
     <Remo.Badii@psi.ch>.

   * Create template for (first) line of tabular environment.

   * I think prompting for the master is the intended behaviour.  It
     corresponds to a `shared' value for TeX-master.

     There should probably be a `none' value which wouldn't query for
     the master, but instead disable all features that relies on
     TeX-master.

     This default value for TeX-master could then be controled with
     mapping based on the extension.

   * Multiple argument completion for `\bibliography'.  In general, I
     ought to make `,' special for these kind of completions.

   * Suggest `makindex' when appropriate.

   * AUCTeX should be able to parse LaTeX2e `.cls' files.  Here are the
     regexps by `<thiemann@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>' Peter Thiemann.

               ("\\\\DeclareRobustCommand{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?\\[\\([0-9]+\\)\\]\
          \\[\\([^\]\\\\\n\r]+\\)\\]"
                (1 2 3) LaTeX-auto-optional)
               ("\\\\DeclareRobustCommand{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?\\[\\([0-9]+\\)\\]"
                (1 2) LaTeX-auto-arguments)
               ("\\\\DeclareRobustCommand{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?" 1 TeX-auto-symbol)
               ("\\\\DeclareFixedFont{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?"
                1 TeX-auto-symbol)
               ("\\\\Declare\\(Text\\|Old\\)FontCommand{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?"
                2 TeX-auto-symbol)
               ("\\\\DeclareMath\\(Symbol\\|Delimiter\\|Accent\\|Radical\\){?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?"
                2 TeX-auto-symbol)
               ;;; it is also valid to declare just a single symbol, e.g. <,
               ;;; with \DeclareMathSymbol but it is not necessary to register that here
               ("\\\\DeclareText\\(Command\\|Symbol\\|Accent\\|Composite\\){?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?"
                2 TeX-auto-symbol)

   * Use index files (when available) to speed up `C-c C-m include
     <RET>'.

   * Option not to calculate very slow completions like for `C-c C-m
     include <RET>'.

   * Font menu should be created from `TeX-font-list'.

   * Installation procedure written purely in emacs lisp.

   * Included PostScript files should also be counted as part of the
     document.

   * The parser should catch warnings about undefined crossreferences.
     Suggested by Richard Hirsch `i3080501@ws.rz.tu-bs.de'.

   * A nice hierarchical by-topic organization of all officially
     documented LaTeX macros, available from the menu bar.

   * `TeX-command-default' should be set from the master file, if not
     set locally.  Suggested by Peter Whaite `<peta@cim.mcgill.ca>'.

   * Make AUCTeX work with `crypt++'.  Suggested by Chris Moore
     `<Chris.Moore@src.bae.co.uk>'.

   * The `Spell' command should apply to all files in a document.  Maybe
     it could try to restrict to files that have been modified since
     last spell check?  Suggested by Ravinder Bhumbla
     `<rbhumbla@ucsd.edu>'.

   * Make <.> check for abbreviations and sentences ending with capital
     letters.

   * Use Emacs 19 minibuffer history to choose between previewers, and
     other stuff.  Suggested by John Interrante
     `<interran@uluru.Stanford.EDU>'.

   * Make features.

     A new command `TeX-update' (`C-c C-u') could be used to create an
     up-to-date dvi file by repeatedly running BibTeX, MakeIndex and
     (La)TeX, until an error occurs or we are done.

     An alternative is to have an `Update' command that ensures the
     `dvi' file is up to date.  This could be called before printing and
     previewing.

   * Documentation of variables that can be set in a style hook.

     We need a list of what can safely be done in an ordinary style
     hook.  You can not set a variable that AUCTeX depends on, unless
     AUCTeX knows that it has to run the style hooks first.

     Here is the start of such a list.
    `LaTeX-add-environments'

    `TeX-add-symbols'

    `LaTeX-add-labels'

    `LaTeX-add-bibliographies'

    `LaTeX-largest-level'

   * Completion for counters and sboxes.

   * Outline should be (better) supported in TeX mode.

     At least, support headers, trailers, as well as TeX-outline-extra.

   * `TeX-header-start' and `TeX-trailer-end'.

     We might want these, just for fun (and outlines)

   * Plain TeX and LaTeX specific header and trailer expressions.

     We should have a way to globally specify the default value of the
     header and trailer regexps.

   * Add support for original `TeX-mode' keybindings.

     A third initialization file (`tex-mode.el') containing an emulator
     of the standard `TeX-mode' would help convince some people to
     change to AUCTeX.

   * Make `TeX-next-error' parse ahead and store the results in a list,
     using markers to remember buffer positions in order to be more
     robust with regard to line numbers and changed files.  This is what
     `next-error' does. (Or did, until Emacs 19).

   * When `LaTeX-environment' is given an argument, change the current
     environment.  Be smart about `\item[]' versus `\item ' and labels
     like `fig:' versus `tab:'.

   * Finish the Texinfo mode.  For one thing, many Texinfo mode
     commands do not accept braces around their arguments.

   * Support for AMSLaTeX style files.

   * Hook up the letter environment with `bbdb.el'.

Bugs
====

   * Filling messes up comments, but only at the end of the file.
     Reported by Juergen Reiss <psy3022@rzbox.uni-wuerzburg.de>.

   * `C-c C-q C-e' doesn't work properly on nested itemize environments.
     Reported by  "Robert B. Love"  <rlove@raptor.rmNUG.ORG>.

   * `C-c '' should always stay in the current window, also when it find
     a new file.

   * Do not overwrite emacs warnings about existing auto-save files when
     loading a new file.

   * Maybe the regexp for matching a TeX symbol during parsing should be
     `"\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\|.\\)"' --
     `<thiemann@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>' Peter Thiemann.

   * AUCTeX should not parse verbatim environments.

   * LaTeX formatting should skip `verbatim' environments.

   * The argument to `\verb' may be broken when filling if it contains a
     space.  This should be fixed or documented.  Suggested by several
     people.

   * Make ``' check for math context in `LaTeX-math-mode'. and simply
     self insert if not in a math context.

   * Make `TeX-insert-dollar' more robust.  Currently it can be fooled
     by `\mbox''es and escaped double dollar for example.

   * Fix bug with `TeX-show-environment' from hidden document
     environment.

   * Correct indentation for tabular, tabbing, table, math, and array
     environments.
