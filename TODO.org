* Package bugs
** Unreported bugs
These bugs should be reported via the BTS.
*** TODO missing workaround for #560317
- dpkg-reconfigure does not set DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE (et al)
Due to this bug I had to add a workaround to auctex.postinst to let
"dpkg-reconfigure auctex" work; "dpkg-reconfigure preview-latex-style" does
not work because of dh_installtex added stuff to preview-latex-style.postinst.
*** TODO (unload-feature 'tex-site)
This new feature does not work.  Maybe preview has to be unloaded first, maybe
the lisp startup files do not do the right thing.
*** TODO update reportbug scripts
The scripts should also cater for preview-latex and for the new auctex.el and
preview.el startup files.  In particular, the md5sum of the new startup files
should be reported.
*** TODO selectively update-auctex-elisp
When new (La)TeX macros get installed to the system it would be good to rescan
only them for all installed and supported Emacs flavors; currently all
installed macros get rescanned for each installed and supported Emacs flavor.
** Open bugs
These bugs should be checked to see if they still apply to the current
release.

I'm not sure I can confirm.  Trying to produce a minimal doc, at this moment
I'm here:

    \int h \Big(
    (\mbox{Id} - D_scD_s c^T   - D^2_s c c^T ) {(f + c(D_s f \cdot D_s c)) }
    +  (D_s^2 c {(f \cdot D_s^2 c)}+
    D_s(P(D_s k)) \Big) ~ s

** Non bugs
These are not bugs, even if they might look like as if they were such.
** Unsettled issues
*** TODO XEmacs integration (#63513/#74702, #144846)
XEmacs includes its own AUCTeX: if the Debian auctex package were to provide
an upgrade, it should be careful to avoid load-path conflicts, both for the
byte compiled files as well as for the source elisp files. Moreover, upstream
says that there are not so many feedback by AUCTeX XEmacs users, and states
that GNU Emacs is much better supported.  Is it worth to cater for XEmacs in
the Debian auctex package?

* Miscellaneous stuff
** TODO "auctex.el", "preview-latex.el", "tex-site.el"
Do we need those files (there)?  Wouldn't be better to move the code in
lisp-startup?  Should those files mess with "load-path"?  Make the unload
feature work.
** TODO .nosearch
Do we really need "/usr/share/emacs-snapshot/site-lisp/auctex/.nosearch" and
"/usr/share/emacs-snapshot/site-lisp/auctex/style/.nosearch"?
** TODO Patches to upstream sources
Evaluate and discuss them with upstream developers.
** TODO TeX-printer-list, TeX-printer-default
Is there any simple way to collect local printer info at installation time,
or, even better, at load time?
** TODO xdg-open
Maybe auctex should recommend xdg-open instead of xpdf?  WRTT me think source
specials need to be considered.
