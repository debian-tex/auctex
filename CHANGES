==========

   * The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain TeX,
     LaTeX, ConTeXt etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
     `TeX-command-menu' has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
     and the customization will not work correctly.

   * If `TeX-master' is set to `t', AUCTeX will now query for a master
     file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
     alone.  The new function `TeX-master-file-ask' is provided for
     adding the variable manually.

   * Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font.  The variable
     `font-latex-title-fontity' can be customized to restore the old
     appearance, i.e. the usage of a different color instead of a
     change in size.

   * Support for `alphanum.sty', `beamer.cls', `booktabs.sty',
     `emp.sty' and `paralist.sty' was added.

   * AUCTeX may now be customized to fontify either >>German<< or
     <<French>> quotes by changing the variable `font-latex-quotes'.

   * Certain TeX/LaTeX function, reference, variable and warning
     keywords will now be fontified.  Own keywords may be added by
     customizing the variables `font-latex-match-function-keywords',
     `font-latex-match-reference-keywords',
     `font-latex-match-variable-keywords' and
     `font-latex-match-warning-keywords'.

   * If you include the style files `german' or `ngerman' in a document
     (directly or via the `babel' package), you should now customize
     `LaTeX-german-open-quote', `LaTeX-german-close-quote' and
     `LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote' instead of `TeX-open-quote',
     `TeX-close-quote' and `TeX-quote-after-quote' if you want to
     influence the type of quote insertion.

   * AUCTeX now includes support for ConTeXt.

   * AUCTeX now is able to determine automatically which viewer to
     choose and what parameters to pass to it by looking at the
     extension of the output file and certain options used in the
     source file.  The behavior can be adapted or extended respectively
     by customizing the variable `TeX-output-view-style'.

   * `TeX-run-discard' is now able to completely detach a process that
     it started.

   * The build process was enhanced and is now based on `autoconf'.

   * Support for the KOMA-Script classes.  Contributed by Mark Trettin
     <Mark.Trettin@gmx.de>.

   * Many more LaTeX and LaTeX2e commands are supported.  Done by
     Masayuki Ataka  <ataka@milk.freemail.ne.jp>

   * Support for `prosper.sty', see <http://prosper.sourceforge.net/>.
     Contributed by Phillip Lord <p.lord@russet.org.uk>.

   * You can now switch between using the `font-latex' (all emacsen),
     the `tex-font' (Emacs 21 only) or no special package for font
     locking.  Customize `TeX-install-font-lock' for this.

   * Now use -t landscape by default when landscape option appears.
     Suggested by Erik Frisk <frisk@isy.liu.se>.

   * Use `tex-fptex.el' for fpTeX support.  Contributed by Fabrice
     Popineau <Fabrice.Popineau@supelec.fr>.

   * New user option `LaTeX-top-caption-list' specifies environments
     where the caption should go at top.  Contributed by
     ataka@milk.freemail.ne.jp (Masayuki Ataka).

   * Allow explicit dimensions in `graphicx.sty'.  Contributed by
     ataka@milk.freemail.ne.jp (Masayuki Ataka).

   * Limited support for `verbatim.sty'.  Contributed by
     ataka@milk.freemail.ne.jp (Masayuki Ataka).

   * Better support for asmmath items.  Patch by
     ataka@milk.freemail.ne.jp (Masayuki Ataka).

   * More accurate error parsing.  Added by David Kastrup
     <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>.

   * Bug fixes.
