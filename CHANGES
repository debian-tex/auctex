=============

   * The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain TeX,
     LaTeX, ConTeXt etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
     `TeX-command-menu' has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
     and the customization will not work correctly.

   * Limited support for `doc.sty' (`dtx' files) was added.  The new
     docTeX mode provides functionality for editing documentation
     parts.  This includes formatting (indenting and filling), adding
     macros and environments while staying in comments as well as syntax
     highlighting.  Please note that the mode is by for not finished
     yet.

   * Support for ConTeXt with a separate ConTeXt mode is now included.
     Macro definitions for completion are available in Dutch and
     English.

   * The filling and indentation code was overhauled and is now able to
     format commented parts of the source syntactically correct.  Newly
     available functionality and customization options are explained in
     the manual.

   * If `TeX-master' is set to `t', AUCTeX will now query for a master
     file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
     alone.  The new function `TeX-master-file-ask' (bound to `C-c _'
     is provided for adding the variable manually.

   * Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font on display
     devices which support such fontification.  The variable
     `font-latex-title-fontity' can be customized to restore the old
     appearance, i.e. the usage of a different color instead of a
     change in size.

   * Support for `alphanum.sty', `beamer.cls', `booktabs.sty',
     `emp.sty' and `paralist.sty' was added.  Credits go to the authors
     mentioned in the respective AUCTeX style files.

   * The commenting functionality was fixed.  The separate functions for
     commenting and uncommenting were unified in one function for
     paragraphs and regions respectively which do both.

   * Syntax highlighting can be customized to fontify quotes delimited
     by either >>German<< or <<French>> quotation marks by changing the
     variable `font-latex-quotes'.

   * Certain TeX/LaTeX keywords for functions, references, variables
     and warnings will now be fontified specially.  You may add your own
     keywords by customizing the variables
     `font-latex-match-function-keywords',
     `font-latex-match-reference-keywords',
     `font-latex-match-variable-keywords' and
     `font-latex-match-warning-keywords'.

   * If you include the style files `german' or `ngerman' in a document
     (directly or via the `babel' package), you should now customize
     `LaTeX-german-open-quote', `LaTeX-german-close-quote' and
     `LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote' instead of `TeX-open-quote',
     `TeX-close-quote' and `TeX-quote-after-quote' if you want to
     influence the type of quote insertion.

   * Upon viewing an output file, the right viewer and command line
     options for it are now determined automatically by looking at the
     extension of the output file and certain options used in the
     source file.  The behavior can be adapted or extended respectively
     by customizing the variable `TeX-output-view-style'.

   * `TeX-run-discard' is now able to completely detach a process that
     it started.

   * The build process was enhanced and is now based on `autoconf'.
