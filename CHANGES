Changes and New Features in AUCTeX
**********************************

News in 11.50
=============

   * The use of source specials when processing or viewing the document
     can now be controlled with the new `TeX-source-specials' minor mode
     which can be toggled via an entry in the Command menu or the key
     binding `C-c C-t C-s'.  If you have customized the variable
     `TeX-command-list', you have to re-initialize it for this to work.
     This means to open a customization buffer for the variable by
     typing `M-x customize-variable RET TeX-command-list RET', selecting
     "Erase Customization" and do your customization again with the new
     default.

   * The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain TeX,
     LaTeX, ConTeXt etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
     `TeX-command-list' has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
     and the customization will not work correctly.

   * Support for hiding and auto-revealing macros, e.g. footnotes or
     citations, and environments in a buffer was added, *Note Folding::.

   * You can now control if indentation is done upon typing <RET> by
     customizing the variable `TeX-newline-function', *Note Indenting::.

   * Limited support for `doc.sty' and `ltxdoc.cls' (`dtx' files) was
     added.  The new docTeX mode provides functionality for editing
     documentation parts.  This includes formatting (indenting and
     filling), adding and completion of macros and environments while
     staying in comments as well as syntax highlighting.  (Please note
     that the mode is not finished yet.  For example syntax
     highlighting does not work yet in XEmacs.)

   * For macro completion in docTeX mode the AUCTeX style files
     `doc.el', `ltxdoc.el' and `ltx-base.el' were included.  The latter
     provides general support for low-level LaTeX macros and may be
     used with LaTeX class and style files as well.  It is currently
     not loaded automatically for those files.

   * Support for ConTeXt with a separate ConTeXt mode is now included.
     Macro definitions for completion are available in Dutch and
     English.

   * The filling and indentation code was overhauled and is now able to
     format commented parts of the source syntactically correct.  Newly
     available functionality and customization options are explained in
     the manual.

   * Filling and indentation in XEmacs with preview-latex and activated
     previews lead to the insertion of whitespace before multi-line
     previews.  AUCTeX now contains facilities to prevent this problem.

   * If `TeX-master' is set to `t', AUCTeX will now query for a master
     file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
     alone.  The new function `TeX-master-file-ask' (bound to `C-c _'
     is provided for adding the variable manually.

   * Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font on display
     devices which support such fontification.  The variable
     `font-latex-title-fontity' can be customized to restore the old
     appearance, i.e. the usage of a different color instead of a
     change in size.

   * Support for `alphanum.sty', `beamer.cls', `booktabs.sty',
     `captcont.sty', `emp.sty', `paralist.sty', `subfigure.sty' and
     `units.sty'/`nicefrac.sty' was added.  Credits go to the authors
     mentioned in the respective AUCTeX style files.

   * Inserting graphics with `C-c RET \includegraphics RET' was
     improved.  See the variable `LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist'.

   * If `LaTeX-default-position' is `nil', don't prompt for position
     arguments in Tabular-like environments, see *Note Tabular-like::.

   * Completion for available packages when using `C-c RET \usepackage
     RET' was improved on systems using the kpathsea library.

   * The commenting functionality was fixed.  The separate functions for
     commenting and uncommenting were unified in one function for
     paragraphs and regions respectively which do both.

   * Syntax highlighting can be customized to fontify quotes delimited
     by either >>German<< or <<French>> quotation marks by changing the
     variable `font-latex-quotes'.

   * Certain TeX/LaTeX keywords for functions, references, variables
     and warnings will now be fontified specially.  You may add your own
     keywords by customizing the variables
     `font-latex-match-function-keywords',
     `font-latex-match-reference-keywords',
     `font-latex-match-variable-keywords' and
     `font-latex-match-warning-keywords'.

   * If you include the style files `german' or `ngerman' in a document
     (directly or via the `babel' package), you should now customize
     `LaTeX-german-open-quote', `LaTeX-german-close-quote' and
     `LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote' instead of `TeX-open-quote',
     `TeX-close-quote' and `TeX-quote-after-quote' if you want to
     influence the type of quote insertion.

   * Upon viewing an output file, the right viewer and command line
     options for it are now determined automatically by looking at the
     extension of the output file and certain options used in the
     source file.  The behavior can be adapted or extended respectively
     by customizing the variable `TeX-output-view-style'.

   * You can control whether `TeX-insert-macro' (`C-c RET') ask for all
     optional arguments by customizing the variable
     `TeX-insert-macro-default-style', *Note Completion::.

   * `TeX-run-discard' is now able to completely detach a process that
     it started.

   * The build process was enhanced and is now based on `autoconf'
     making installing AUCTeX a mostly automatic process.  See *Note
     Installation:: and *Note Installation under MS Windows:: for
     details.
