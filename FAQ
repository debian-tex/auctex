Frequently Asked Questions about AUCTeX
***************************************

  1. What versions of Emacs and XEmacs are supported?

     AUCTeX was tested with Emacs 21 and XEmacs 21.4.15.  Older
     versions may work but are unsupported.  Older versions of XEmacs
     might possibly made to work by updating the `xemacs-base' package
     through the XEmacs package system.

  2. Why doesn't the completion or multifile stuff work?

     It must be enabled first, insert this in your emacs:

          (setq-default TeX-master nil)
          (setq TeX-parse-self t)
          (setq TeX-auto-save t)

     Read also the chapters about parsing and multifile documents in the
     manual.

  3. Why doesn't `TeX-save-document' work?

     `TeX-check-path' has to contain "./" somewhere.

  4. Why is the information in `foo.tex' forgotten when I save
     `foo.bib'?

     For various reasons, AUCTeX ignores the extension when it stores
     information about a file, so you should use unique base names for
     your files.  E.g. rename `foo.bib' to `foob.bib'.

  5. Why doesn't AUCTeX signal when processing a document is done?

     If the message in the minibuffer stays "Type `C-c C-l' to display
     results of compilation.", you probably have a misconfiguration in
     your init file (`.emacs', `init.el' or similar).  To track this
     down either search in the `*Messages*' buffer for an error message
     or put `(setq debug-on-error t)' as the first line into your init
     file, restart Emacs and open a LaTeX file.  Emacs will complain
     loudly by opening a debugging buffer as soon as an error occurs.
     The information in the debugging buffer can help you find the
     cause of the error in your init file.
