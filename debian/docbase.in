Title: AUCTeX: An integrated environment for writing TeX/LaTeX documents
Author: Kresten Krab Thorup, Per Abrahamsen, David Kastrup
Abstract: AUCTeX is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for
 writing input files for TeX/LaTeX using GNU Emacs.
 .
 AUCTeX lets you run TeX/LaTeX and other LaTeX-related tools, such as a output
 filters or post processor from inside Emacs.  Especially `running LaTeX' is
 interesting, as AUCTeX lets you browse through the errors TeX reported, while
 it moves the cursor directly to the reported error, and displays some
 documentation for that particular error.  This will even work when the
 document is spread over several files.
 .
 AUCTeX automatically indents your `LaTeX-source', not only as you write it --
 you can also let it indent and format an entire document.  It has a special
 outline feature, which can greatly help you `getting an overview' of a
 document.
 .
 Apart from these special features, AUCTeX provides a large range of handy
 Emacs macros, which in several different ways can help you write your LaTeX
 documents fast and painlessly.
 .
  All features of AUCTeX are documented using the GNU Emacs online
 documentation system.  That is, documentation for any command is just a key
 click away!
 .
 AUCTeX is written entirely in Emacs-Lisp, and hence you can easily add new
 features for your own needs.  It was not made as part of any particular
 employment or project (apart from the AUCTeX project itself).  AUCTeX is
 distributed under the `GNU Emacs General Public License' and may therefore
 almost freely be copied and redistributed.
