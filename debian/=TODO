* Package bugs

** Unreported bugs
   These bugs should be reported via the BTS.
*** TODO Configuration files
    Rethink about the issue of configuration files.  Are we really sure that
    files in "/etc/emacs*/site-lisp.d/" should be editable by the system
    administrator?  They should probably contain only autoload code and
    defcustoms.
*** TODO (unload-feature 'tex-site)
    This new feature does not work.  Maybe preview has to be unloaded first,
    maybe the lisp startup files do not do the right thing.
*** DGMS update reportbug scripts
    The scripts should also cater for preview-latex and for the new auctex.el
    and preview.el startup files.  In particular, the md5sum of the new
    startup files should be reported.
*** TODO The "autoload has changed" message
    Do not display it if there was no auctex installed.  Also, Frank K端ster:
    ``The debconf note "defaultchanged" is shown for all upgraders, but it
    isn't really that necessary for people who have enabled site-wide
    autoloading, anyway.  One could grep for ^[[:space:]]*(require 'tex-site) in
    /etc/emacs21/site-start.d/50auctex.el.''  DGMS replies: ``Not sure about
    this: does that means that auctex would require a preinst script?  (I have
    to check this, but I think that file would have been overwritten before
    the new postinst gets executed, or maybe removed by the old prerm.)  Also,
    how should this cope with sysadmins who enabled site-wide auto-loading,
    but only for emacs21 and not for emacs-snapshot, or viceversa?''
*** TODO The uncompressed Changelog file in site-lisp/auctex
    Frank K端ster: ``You install the uncompressed Changelog file in
    site-lisp/auctex, but the comment sounds as if you don't really like that.
    Wouldn't it be sufficient to store only the first lines of that file?''
    DGMS replies: ``It would probably be sufficient, but once we have
    cluttered that location I'm unsure if the need to manually update the
    Changelog file at each release is worth saving some 300kB.  Or do you
    suggest using head to select just the few N lines?  Maybe csplit would be
    the right tool, since we just (I think) have to save the first lines until
    the most recent version statement gets included (I'm also thinking about
    CVS snapshots here, so that that statement might be not in the very first
    lines).  Comments?''
*** DONE /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/auctex/preview/autom4te.cache/
    It should be cleaned after emacsen install.
*** DONE Install preview-latex-style docs in the right place
    Frank K端ster: ``preview-latex-style installs files into
    /usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/styles/; however /usr/share/texmf/doc is a
    symlink (to ../doc/texfm).  The files end up in the right place because
    dpkg just follows the symlink, but find reports them at a different
    location that dlocate or dpkg -L.  The right location would be
    /usr/share/doc/texmf/latex/styles/.''

** Open bugs
   These bugs should be checked to see if they still apply to the current
   release.
*** TODO #120031
*** DONE #144846
    The preview-latex package has been absorbed by AUCTeX.  This bug is no
    longer necessary, see also #63513.
*** TODO #177237
*** TODO #276102
*** DONE #277885
    Fixed upstream, close it by debian/changelog.
*** TODO #290635
*** TODO #293161
    Probably an old bug, which should be closed.
*** TODO #295730
*** TODO #300933: The clean target should work fine.
    Check the statement and close the bug via debian/changelog.
*** TODO #311292
    Analyze the bug and the provided patch.
*** TODO #317610
*** DONE #318114: Fixed according to DAK.
    Check the statement and close the bug via debian/changelog.
*** TODO #321069
    To be tested with gs-esp.
*** DONE #324358: emacs-snapshot is now a supported flavor.
    Close the bug.
*** DONE #329061
    Old bug, close it.
*** DONE #331751
    Closed in 11.81-1.
*** TODO #333925
    Merge with #63513 (wishlist wontfix).
*** TODO #335017
    Submitter states this is no longer an open bug, close it.
*** TODO #341213
    Tag it wishlist upstream; upstream said it won't get fixed.
*** TODO #344285
    Packaging has changed: this bug no longer applies to auctex >= 11.81-1.
    Thank Ricardo Javier Cardenes Medina <rcardenes@debian.org> for reporting
    and close it.
*** TODO #347472
    Fixed in 11.81-2, close it.
*** DONE #349330, #349471, #349620
    Closed by auctex 11.82-1.
*** DONE #349662
    Closed by auctex 11.82-1.

** Non bugs
   These are not bugs, even if they might look like as if they were such.
*** DONE po-debconf: Fails to merge a number of translations.
    This is due to the "fuzzy" mark: fuzzy entries are not included.  On the
    other hand, fuzzy entries should really be reviewed by some translator, so
    this is ok.

** Unsettled issues
*** TODO XEmacs integration (#63513/#74702, #144846)
    XEmacs includes its own AUCTeX: if the Debian auctex package were to
    provide an upgrade, it should be careful to avoid load-path conflicts,
    both for the byte compiled files as well as for the source elisp files.
    Moreover, upstream says that there are not so many feedback by AUCTeX
    XEmacs users, and states that GNU Emacs is much better supported.  Is it
    worth to cater for XEmacs in the Debian auctex package?


* Miscellaneous stuff

** TODO Add some lintian override.
   auctex: extra-license-file usr/share/doc/auctex/src/copying.texi.gz
   auctex: doc-base-file-unknown-format auctex:38 texinfo
   auctex: doc-base-file-unknown-format preview-latex:11 texinfo
   auctex: executable-not-elf-or-script ./usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/auctex/install-sh
   auctex: debconf-is-not-a-registry ./usr/sbin/update-auctex-install
** TODO Lintian thingies
   auctex: malformed-prompt-in-templates auctex/doauto
   auctex: malformed-prompt-in-templates auctex/doautofg
** TODO "auctex.el", "preview-latex.el", "tex-site.el"
   Do we need those files (there)?  Wouldn't be better to move the code in
   lisp-startup?  Should those files mess with "load-path"?  Make the unload
   feature work.
** TODO .nosearch
   Do we really need "/usr/share/emacs-snapshot/site-lisp/auctex/.nosearch"?
** DONE Consider comaintainingship
   Talk to Makoto OHURA <ohura@debian.org>.
** DGMS Patches to upstream sources
   Evaluate and discuss them with upstream developers.
** DONE Install byte compiled preview-latex files under the auctex directory
   Done upstream.
** DONE Test with new teTeX 3.0
** DONE Test with TeX Live
   Also add proper alternative dependencies.
** TODO /usr/sbin/update-auctex-install
   Get the proper packages (teTeX?, ...?) to use it, add perhaps a note in the
   README.Debian file.
** TODO TeX-printer-list, TeX-printer-default
   Is there any simple way to collect local printer info at installation time,
   or, even better, at load time?
