The Debian package auctex
-------------------------


Loading AUC TeX
===============

Users will need to put "(require 'tex-site)" in their "~/.emacs" to load
AUC TeX.

System Administrators wanting to start AUC TeX by default on their site
should put "(require 'tex-site)" in "/etc/emacs/site-start.el".


Online Documentation
====================

Online documentation may be found in the info or HTML manual, and the
update-auctex-lisp(8) manual page.


Note to System Administrators:
==============================

To improve its performance AUC TeX stores informations about (La)TeX style
files available on the system in "/var/lib/auctex/".  AUC TeX updates
these informations weekly, by a cron script; nevertheless, you may want to
run "/usr/sbin/update-auctex-elisp" manually after installing new style
files under "/usr/local/lib/texmf".  (Formerly "update-auctex-elisp" was
named "auctex-auto-load": there's now a symlink for compatibility reason,
that will eventually disappear in future releases: you are advised to NOT
use it).
