Description: How should (La)TeX macros be parsed?
 To greatly improve AUC TeX performances, every TeX macro package and
 LaTeX style file currently installed on your system will be parsed.
 .
 This may take a lot of time, so it should be probably done in
 background, but you may also choose to have it done in foreground, or
 to skip the parsing at all instead.  If you choose Background, you
 will find a detailed log of the process in the file:
    ${LOGFILE}
 .
 A weekly cron job will also take care of upgrading the informations
 collected now, so usually you won't need to worry about them when you
 install new (La)TeX packages or remove old ones.
 .
 Anyway, you can update them by hand running <:=$UPDATE:>.
