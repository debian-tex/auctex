Description: Should AUC-TeX be auto-loaded by default at your site?
 Emacs has its own standard (La)TeX major modes, that will be globally (i.e.,
 for all users on this site) overridden if you answer yes to this question.
 This is generally a good thing, since AUC-TeX is so better; however you may
 not want it to happen, and let instead single users at your site decide by
 themselves if they should load this package.
 .
 If you answer no, people who desire to use it will have to put the string
 "(require 'tex-site)" in their "~/.emacs" to load it.

Type: text
Description: AUC-TeX seems to be already auto-loaded at your site.  Good.
 By inspection of the file "<:=$SSEL:>" AUC-TeX seems to be
 already auto-loaded by default at your site.
 .
 If this is not true, or if it's not what you want, please search that file
 looking for "(require 'tex-site)" resembling forms and fix it; then run
 "dpkg-reconfigure <:=$PACKAGE:>" if needed (recommended).

Template: <:=$PACKAGE:>/doauto
Type: select
Choices: Background, Foreground, None
Default: Background
Description: How should (La)TeX macros be parsed?
 To greatly improve AUC-TeX performances, every TeX macro package and LaTeX
 style file currently installed on your system will be parsed.
 .
 This may take a lot of time, so it should be probably done in background, but
 you may also choose to have it done in foreground, or to skip the parsing at
 all instead.  If you choose Background, you will find a detailed log of the
 process in the file: ${LOGFILE}.
 .
 A weekly cron job will also take care of upgrading the informations collected
 now, so usually you won't need to worry about them whenever you install new
 (La)TeX packages or remove old ones.
 .
 Anyway, you can update them by hand running <:=$UPDATE:>.
