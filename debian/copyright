This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the AUC TeX Emacs lisp
package.

The current release of this package was assembled by:
		 Davide G. M. Salvetti <salve@debian.org>
using sources obtained from:
<ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/auctex/auctex-9.9a.tar.gz>.

The current AUC TeX upstream maintainer is:
	       Per Abrahamsen <auc-tex_mgr@sunsite.auc.dk>.

The original AUC Tex Debian package was assembled by:
	    Helmut Geyer <Helmut.Geyer@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>.

Obviously, tex-site.el has been appropriately configured for Debian
GNU/Linux.
