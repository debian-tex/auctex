This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the AUC TeX Emacs lisp
package.

The current release of this package was assembled by Davide G. M. Salvetti
<salve@debian.org> using sources obtained from:
<ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/auxtex/auctex-9.8i.tar.gz>.

The current AUC TeX upstream maintainer is Per Abrahamsen
<auc-tex_mgr@sunsite.auc.dk>.

The original AUC Tex Debian package was assembled by Helmut Geyer
<Helmut.Geyer@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>.

Obviously, tex-site.el has been appropriately configured for Debian
GNU/Linux.
