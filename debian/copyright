This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the AUC TeX Emacs lisp
package.

The current release of this package was assembled by:
		 Davide G. M. Salvetti <salve@debian.org>
using sources obtained from:
       <ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/auctex/>
(file: "6548d9d41d0902fb927abfa8c418195a  auctex-9.9b.tar.gz").
Please, note that that sources are considered to be in `alpha' state
by their maintainer, although they have been tested to some degree by
myself.

The official upstream ftp site is:
	       <ftp://sunsite.auc.dk/packages/auctex/>,
not <ftp://ftp.iesd.auc.dk/pub/emacs-lisp/> as sated in the README
file.

The current AUC TeX upstream maintainer is:
	       Per Abrahamsen <auc-tex_mgr@sunsite.auc.dk>.

The original AUC Tex Debian package was assembled by:
	    Helmut Geyer <Helmut.Geyer@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>.

Obviously, tex-site.el has been appropriately configured for Debian
GNU/Linux.
