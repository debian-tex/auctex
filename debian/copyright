This is Debian/GNU Linux's prepackaged version of the AUC TeX
Emacs lisp package. The package was assembeled by Helmut Geyer
<Helmut.Geyer@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de> using sources obtained from 
<ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/auctex/auctex-9.7l.tar.gz>

Some adjustments to Makefile were necessary and tex.el was changed in order
to improve the TeX-auto-generate and TeX-auto-generate-global functions.

AUC TeX is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2;
for details see the file /usr/doc/GPL which contains the complete text
of the license.
