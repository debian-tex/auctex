"Since Debian version 11.81-1, AUCTeX gets autoloaded by default.  Users who "
"do not want AUCTeX to override the standard Emacs TeX-mode may unload AUCTeX "
"completely by evaluating the form \"(unload-feature 'tex-site)\" (i.e., let "
"them put that string into their personal \"~/.emacs\" or \"~/.emacs.el\" "
"file to disable AUCTeX completely)."
