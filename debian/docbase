Title: AUC TeX: An integrated environment for writing TeX/LaTeX documents.
Author: Kresten Krab Thorup, Per Abrahamsen
Abstract: AUC TeX can indent your text as you write it, let you run
 TeX/LaTeX and other LaTeX-related tools (such as a output filter or
 post processor) from within Emacs, and includes a wide range of Emacs
 macros to allow both easy insertions of LaTeX commands, and easy
 compilation, previewing, and printing of your TeX documents.
 AUC TeX also lets you browse through compiling errors TeX reports,
 while it moves the cursor directly to the reported error and displays
 documentation for that particular error.  This will even work when
 the document is spread over several files.
