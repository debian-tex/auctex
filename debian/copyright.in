This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the AUC TeX Emacs lisp
package.

The current release of this package was assembled by:
		 Davide G. M. Salvetti <salve@debian.org>
using sources obtained from:
	       <ftp://sunsite.auc.dk/packages/auctex/>,
(file: "d20c048f8f90c9281dbef4d51b707e09  auctex-9.9p.tar.gz").

The official upstream ftp site is:
	       <ftp://sunsite.auc.dk/packages/auctex/>,
not <ftp://ftp.iesd.auc.dk/pub/emacs-lisp/> as sated in the README
file.

The current AUC TeX upstream maintainer is:
	       Per Abrahamsen <auc-tex_mgr@sunsite.auc.dk>.

The original AUC Tex Debian package was assembled by:
	    Helmut Geyer <Helmut.Geyer@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>.

Obviously, tex-site.el has been appropriately configured for Debian
GNU/Linux.

I applied a Japanese specific patch, see japanese-patch for code, and
japanese-patch-copyright for authors and copyright information.  Its
feature are:

 * TeX command is "jlatex" or "platex" for most Japanese TeX user.
 * [bug fix] TeX menu is not changed in "japanese-LaTeX-mode".
 * [bug fix] TeX-command-style updated for Emacs20.
 * [bug fix] fill mode doesn't work in Emacs20.
 * japanese-latex-mode is not loaded, so need to add the entry to
   TeX-format-list in tex.el.  It doesn't need to be set
   TeX-format-list in tex-jp.el.
