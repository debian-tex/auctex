_Description: The autoload mechanism of AUCTeX has changed.
 Since Debian version 11.81-1, AUCTeX gets autoloaded by default.  If you do
 not want AUCTeX to override the standard Emacs TeX-mode, you may unload
 AUCTeX completely by evaluating the form "(unload-feature 'tex-site)"
 (i.e., put that string into your "~/.emacs" to disable AUCTeX completely).

Template: auctex/doauto
Type: select
__Choices: Background, Foreground, None
Default: Background
_Description: How should (La)TeX macros be parsed?
 To greatly improve AUCTeX performances, every TeX macro package and LaTeX
 style file currently installed at your site will be parsed.
 .
 This may take a lot of time, so it should be probably done in background;
 however you may also choose to have it done in foreground, or to skip the
 parsing at all instead.  If you choose Background, you will find a
 detailed log of the process in the file: ${LOGFILE}.
 .
 A weekly cron job will also take care of updating the informations now
 collected, so usually you won't need to worry about them whenever you
 install new (La)TeX packages or remove old ones.
 .
 Anyway, you can update them by hand running update-auctex-elisp.

Template: auctex/doautofg
Type: select
__Choices: Console, File
Default: File
_Description: Where should parsing output go?
 You chose to parse TeX macro packages and LaTeX style files in foreground.
 This is ok, but normally it will also generate quite a lot of output.
 .
 By default -- i.e., answering File to this question -- further output from
 the parsing process will go to a file named: ${LOGFILE}.
 .
 If you answer Console, you will see all of the (boring) output right on
 your terminal.
