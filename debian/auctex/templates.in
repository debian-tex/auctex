_Description: The autoload mechanism of AUCTeX has changed
 Since Debian version 11.81-1, AUCTeX gets autoloaded by default.  Users who
 do not want AUCTeX to override the standard Emacs TeX-mode may unload
 AUCTeX completely by evaluating the form "(unload-feature 'tex-site)"
 (i.e., let them put that string into their personal "~/.emacs" or
 "~/.emacs.el" file to disable AUCTeX completely).

Template: auctex/doauto
Type: select
__Choices: Background, Foreground, None
Default: Background
_Description: (La)TeX macros parsing mode:
 To greatly improve AUCTeX performances, every TeX macro package and LaTeX
 style file currently installed at your site will be parsed.
 .
 This may take a lot of time, so it should be probably done in the
 background; however you may also choose to have it done in the foreground,
 or to skip the parsing at all instead.  If you choose Background, you will
 find a detailed log of the process in the file: ${LOGFILE}.
 .
 A weekly cron job will also take care of updating the data collected now,
 so usually you won't need to worry about them whenever you install new
 (La)TeX packages or remove old ones.
 .
 Anyway, you can update them by hand running update-auctex-elisp.

Template: auctex/doautofg
Type: select
__Choices: Console, File
Default: File
_Description: Parsing output destination:
 You chose to parse TeX macro packages and LaTeX style files in foreground.
 This is OK, but normally it will also generate quite a lot of output.
 .
 By default -- i.e., answering File to this question -- further output from
 the parsing process will go to a file named: ${LOGFILE}.
 .
 If you answer Console, you will see all of the (boring) output right on
 your terminal.
