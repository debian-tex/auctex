The Debian package <:=${PACKAGE}:> news
-------------------<:="-" x length (${PACKAGE}):>-----


Loading AUCTeX
===============

Since Debian version 11.81-1, AUCTeX gets auto-loaded by default.  If you do
not want AUCTeX to override the standard Emacs TeX-mode, you may unload AUCTeX
completely by evaluating the form "(unload-feature 'tex-site)" (i.e., put that
string into your "~/.emacs" to disable AUCTeX completely).


preview-latex
=============

Since upstream version 11.81, preview-latex comes included with AUCTeX.  You
do not need to do anything special to use it.
