auctex (11.81-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  Since Debian version 11.81-1, AUCTeX gets auto-loaded by default.  If
  you do not want AUCTeX to override the standard Emacs TeX-mode, you
  may unload AUCTeX completely by evaluating the form "(unload-feature
  'tex-site)" (i.e., put that string into your "~/.emacs" to disable
  AUCTeX completely).

  Since upstream version 11.81, preview-latex comes included with AUCTeX.
  You do not need to do anything special to use it.
