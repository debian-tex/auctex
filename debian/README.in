The Debian package auctex
-------------------------


Loading AUC-TeX
===============

Users will need to put "(require 'tex-site)" in their "~/.emacs" to load
AUC-TeX, unless the local system administrator chose to start it by default.

System administrators wanting to start AUC-TeX by default on their site should
answer accordingly at the appropriate configuration time question (and may
issue "dpkg-reconfigure <:=${PACKAGE}:>" if they change their minds afterwards).


RefTeX
======

AUCTeX users will probably want to switch the very useful RefTeX package on, by
adding something like "(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'turn-on-reftex)" to their
"~/.emacs" (see the RefTeX info manual for more information on RefTeX, which is
part of GNU Emacs).


Font-LaTeX
==========

Starting with AUC-TeX 11.01, a new user customizable variable appeared:
"TeX-install-font-lock".  Font-LaTeX it's now the default choice, so users
need not doing anything special to load it anymore.  Emacs 21 users may choose
"tex-font" instead, should they wish it.


Online Documentation
====================

Online documentation may be found in the info or HTML manual, and the
<:=${UPDATE}:>(8) manual page.

TeXInfo sources may be found in the "<:=if($_="${docsrc}")=~tr|/|/|s:>"
directory.


Notes to System Administrators
==============================

A) To improve its performance AUC-TeX stores informations about TeX macros and
LaTeX styles available on the system in the "<:=${var}:>" directory.

AUC-TeX updates these informations weekly, by mean of a cron script;
nevertheless, you may want to run "<:=if($_="${sbin}/${UPDATE}")=~tr|/|/|s:>"
manually after installing new style files under "/usr/local/share/texmf".

B) You may probably want to customize the list of printers available at your
site.

This could be easily accomplished by declaring it in "<:=${SSEL}:>"
(along with the default printer), for example:

(setq TeX-printer-list
      '(("lp" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p")
        ("lpc" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p")
        ("lpf" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p")
        ("lpt" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p"))
      TeX-printer-default "lpf")

Please, look at the online documentation, type `C-h v TeX-printer-list RET'
from within Emacs (load auctex first), or browse through the file
"<:=if($_="${lisp}/tex.el")=~tr|/|/|s:>" for more information on this topic.


Contributed Files
=================

There are several files that are not part of AUC-TeX proper, but included in
the distribution in case they are useful.

    - `hilit-LaTeX.el'
      Better highlighting for the obsolete `hilit19' package.

    - `bib-cite.el'
      Better support for bibliographies and much more.

    - `tex-jp.el'
      Japanese support.

    - `tex-fptex.el'
      fpTeX support.

Read the comments in the start of each file for more information about how to
load, what they do, and who wrote and maintains them.
