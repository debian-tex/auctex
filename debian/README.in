The Debian package auctex
-------------------------


Loading AUC TeX
===============

Users will need to put "(require 'tex-site)" in their "~/.emacs" to load
AUC TeX.

System Administrators wanting to start AUC TeX by default on their site
should put "(require 'tex-site)" in "<:=$SSEL:>".


Online Documentation
====================

Online documentation may be found in the info or HTML manual, and the
<:=$UPDATE:>(8) manual page.

The TeXInfo sources may be found in the "<:=if($_=$docsrc)=~tr|/|/|s:>"
directory.


Notes to System Administrators
==============================

A) To improve its performance AUC TeX stores informations about
(La)TeX style files available on the system in "<:=$varauc:>".
AUC TeX updates these informations weekly, by a cron script;
nevertheless, you may want to run "<:=if($_="$sbin/$UPDATE")=~tr|/|/|s:>"
manually after installing new style files under "/usr/local/share/texmf".

B) You may probably want to customize the list of printers available
at your site.  This could be accomplished by declaring it in
"<:=$SSEL:>" (along with the default printer), for
example:

(setq TeX-printer-list
      '(("lp" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p")
        ("lpc" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p")
        ("lpf" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p")
        ("lpt" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p"))
      TeX-printer-default "lpf")

Please, look at the online documentation, type `C-h v TeX-printer-list
RET' from within Emacs (load auctex first), or browse through
"<:=if($_="$slisp/tex.el")=~tr|/|/|s:>" for more information on
this topic.


Contributed Files
=================

There are several files that are not part of AUC TeX proper, but
included in the distribution in case they are useful.

    - `hilit-LaTeX.el'
      Better highlighting for the obsolete `hilit19' package.

    - `font-latex.el'
      Better highlighting for the FONT-LOCK package.

    - `bib-cite.el'
      Better support for bibliographies and much more.

    - `tex-jp.el'
      Support for Japanese.

Read the comments in the start of each file for more information
about how to load, what they do, and who wrote and maintains them.
